The evidence in this book strongly suggests that the most probable way to join this successful minority is to adopt a strictly realistic in- vestment approach based on objective performance measurement applied to actual market behavior This book offers an accumulated treasury of more than one hundred of the best Technical Market Indicators. These indicators were developed over decades of close daily observation of market price behavior by intensely involved market participants. Technical Market Indicators are designed to make the highly complex investment de- cision-making process relatively simple and effective. We tested all available historical data to show you precisely how to establish specific indicator parameters, clear rules for buying and selling securities, with the objective of maximizing while minimizing risk of loss_ You will be able to judge for yourself the most suitable indicators to apply to your own investment deci- sion making, consistent with your objectives, whether they involve short-term trad- ing, long-term investing, aggressive speculation, O conservation of capital. You will gain a realistic understanding of the actual forecasting value, the strengths, and the weaknesses of a wide range of possible indicator formulas. This book will save the intelligent user years of time and effort attempting to re- discover the best approaches to trading and investing: The wheel has been invented; you don 't have to reinvent it. Many ideas in this book will inspire independent hy- pothesis testing by the imaginative market student; as established concepts may be dissected and recombined in a wide variety of new ways With relatively inexpensive computers, software, and data, any intelligent investor can now access affordable tools to conduct original research: This book provides a rich source of tested ideas for adapting a trading system that is right for you Robert W.

Technical Market Indicators can be selected or discarded based on logic, common sense, and practical workability based on past performance. 2. Technical Market Indicators can be approached in a systematic, scientific way 3. Technical Market Indicators provide a precisely quantified framework for organizing information about actual observed market behavior: 4 Technical Market Indicators can provide firm foundation for making speculative decisions, grounded on historical precedent: 5. Technical Market Indicators save precious time. We do not need to decades of time personally observing the market to learn to take advantage of its behavioral patterns. Effective indicator testing and selection is an eas- ier; quicker; and less costly way to learn from historical precedent: 6. Different Technical Market Indicators can be tailored for each of the three possible trend directions: up, down; and sideways 7 . Technical Market Indicators can be tailored to detect trends in any time frame. Due to the fractal nature of markets, trends unfold in a similar fash- ion in  various time intervals. So Technical Market   Indicators   can be adapted to the dominant major trends that typically last for years, the intermediate-term movements that typically last for a few weeks to a few months, the day-to-day minor trends, and the momentary fluctuations that concern very short-term traders_ 8_ Technical Market Indicators can be applied to the full range of financial in- struments: stocks, futures, commodities, currencies, and anything else that trades in an open market: 9. Technical Market Indicators can be designed to detect trends and probable changes in trends in the timeliest manner available. Markets anticipate the 3 spend Evaluating Technical Market Indicators probable future trends, and Technical Market Indicators put uS on the lead- edge of market trends. In contrast, most investors react too late because are focusing on lagging fundamentals, including current news. 10. Technical Market Indicators allow us to make clear-cut decisions without uncertainty; work; confusion, anxiety, and stress because can be precisely defined and tested. 11. Technical Market Indicators offer precise and objective signals that can free us from forecasts, opinion, bias, ego, greed, and fear; which interfere with accurate perception of developing market trends. By acting on objec- tive Technical Market Indicator signals with a dispassionate attitude and a minimum of emotional and mental involvement; can maximize our chances of success_ 12. Our Nine Steps to Walk-Forward Simulation of Technical Market Indica- tors offer an objective and orderly procedure for selecting reasonable and specific Technical Market Indicator parameters  These Nine allow us to establish precise decision rules based on entirely objective back-testing of actual past market behavior 13. Tested and precisely defined Technical Market Indicator rules give us spe- cific signals that allow US to confidently execute trades. We can feel confi- dent because these are the rules that would have maximized reward/risk performance over actual past market behavior: 14. Although the future is unlikely to exactly mirror the past, assuming that fu- ture market behavior will resemble the past is the best available assumption on which to base our current decisions. Thus, we can select specific Tech- nical Market Indicator parameters that would have worked best in the past: 15. Technical Market Indicators can offer more flexibility and adaptability than alternative decision-making methods. Technical analysis can be stretched to include data extraneous to the market analyzed, such as inter-market comparisons, sentiment surveys, and cycle studies, along with data consid- ered fundamental, such as economic and monetary data. Technical analyti- cal tools can detect trends and trend changes in any data series. 16. Technical Market Indicators can be relatively quick and easy to use com- pared to alternative decision-making methods. All too often investment strategy is incompletely defined or excessively complex with an over- whelming number of hard-to-quantify variables. Many complex systems are impossible to understand and monitor: In contrast; many Technical Market  Indicators  offer   simple, sensible, intuitively obvious, easy-to- understand, and precisely defined formulas based on a manageable number of variables. These qualities can enable uS to execute decisions with the timely and disciplined consistency that is vital for success in the financial markets. ing they they guess= hope, we Steps being Introducing Technical Market Indicators 5 17. Technical Market Indicator research always produces valuable information: Even when an indicator fails to produce an obviously useful result; we ben- efit because we can discard that indicator and free our attention for research in other directions. And for very bad indicators that lose money, we can reversing their signals, buying when turn negative and selling when turn positive, if logic permits. 18. Traditional Technical Market Indicators can be adapted to incorporate the most up-to-date and sophisticated mathematical and statistical tools. 19. Conservation of capital is the first rule of prudent investment strategy, and the probability of large losses can be effectively reduced by the disci- plined application of tested Technical Market Indicators. Historical research can allow us to precisely define our methods for risk control. Risk reduction means greater consistency of profitable returns_ 20. Playing the probabilities based on historically tested Technical Market In- dicators, with risk controls to limit damage when the improbable happens, is the best we can do. The alternatives (to search in vain for consistently ac- curate forecasts of the future, to react to news developments, o to follow the latest market guru) do not work 21. Technical Market Indicators are more accessible than ever before. Thanks to improving technology, the historical data necessary for independent re- search is easy to acquire and process 22. Increasingly, Technical Market   Indicators are the  preferred   decision- making tools of well-informed market   participants. Technical Market Indicators are used by the majority of the most successful investors and traders 23. The same Technical Market Indicators used by top-performing traders and investors are available now This book offers the necessary knowledge on how to formulate and test Technical Market Indicators in an orderly; step- by-step fashion. 24. Specific Technical Market Indicator parameters offered in this book would have maximized reward/risk performance over actual market history. Trends Are the Most Important Considerations in Trading and Investing Market prices move in trends. variables influence trends. Market prices lead actual developments in underlying fundamental conditions. Therefore, why trends OC- cur is not always evident in real time. Sometimes, the reasons are not clear even well after the trend is over: Technical Market Indicators are designed simply to identify trends and trend changes without concern underlying causes and effects. Trends persist: We do not need to know how a trend will last: We only need to know that trends continue until something changes in the supply and demand try they they any Many for long 6 Evaluating Technical Market Indicators balance for the financial instrument in the marketplace. And we need to identify trend changes in a timely manner: The market's response to a significant new force unfolds over time as investors of different abilities and various constraints perceive and react to new developments at different rates. Market trends begin like rippling rings of water after a pebble has been tossed into the center of a still pond. At the beginning, the most knowledgeable and best informed players transact their business based on the new reality, and their transactions create the first ripple in the market: Following closely, the second best in- formed react to create second Soon after; the third best informed investors make their trades to create a third And s0 on, until finally the least sophisticated investors respond to the changed environment: By then the trend is over; and a trend reversal is at hand: This is the way directional-price trends unfold in waves of buying and selling: Human beings and sell stocks, and people are moved by their emotions. The emotional state of the crowd, investor psychology apart from all rational fundamen- economic considerations, is the most important determinant of investors' decision- making and therefore f actual market behavior: Investor psychology is revealed in Tape Indicators and in specialized Sentiment Indicators in this book Trends are detectable in several different time frames, ranging from years to moments _ There are three possible trend directions: up, down, O sideways. These trend directions differ in different time frames: major long-term trends that last for years; significant intermediate-term  trends that last from a few weeks to few months; minor short-term trends that last for and noisy momentary trends that concern only short-term traders. Different trend directions and different time frames require   different   specific Technical Market   Indicator   parameters to maximize reward/risk performance. This may seem complex, but this complexity can be man- with an orderly identification of appropriate investment objectives and an O- derly research method as shown in this book: Back-Testing Technical Market Indicators Has Proved to Be Effective One of the great advantages of Technical Market Indicators is that can be tested against actual market history. Some of the world's top-performing traders and in- vestors use back-testing to determine their trading strategies. (See Schwager; Jack D. Market Wizards, Interviews with Traders, New York Institute of Finance, New York; 1989,458 pages: For example, Richard Dennis ran $400 to $200,000,000 in 16 years of trading o the Chicago futures markets (Futures "speculation" is about the same aS stock market "investing' except for high leverage, which greatly magnifies gains and losses. Like nearly all great futures traders, Dennis is a technician who studies the behavior of the market itself. Dennis employs mathematicians and com- puter experts to help him test all known Technical Market Indicators. Based on his re- ring: ring; buy tal days; aged they Top Introducing Technical Market Indicators search, he established a set of trading rules that capitalizes on price trends, cuts losses quickly, and identifies unsustainable excesses. To prove that his methods are valid and not unique to his personal attributes, Dennis taught his trading rules to 23 raw trainees, whom he called his Turtles: Although had no previous trading experi- ence, 20 of the 23 averaged returns of 100% annually. These results suggest that back- testing precisely defined trading rules on historical data is a reasonable way to select trading strategies. Back-testing Technical Market Indicators has proved to be useful in actual prac- tice because the market's behavior patterns do not change dramatically over time. As Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan said, Human psychology molds the value that drives a competitive market economy And that process is inextricably linked to hu- man nature, which appears essentially immutable and, thus, anchors the future to the And as philosopher George Santayana wrote, in Life of Reason (1906), Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it:' Traditionally, most investors make decisions based on some combination of their instincts and the "conventional wisdom" readily available from popular infor- mation sources_ Unfortunately; subjective  consideration of widely discounted known facts leads to poor decisions and below average results. By relying on shifting subjective impressions based on an unsystematic sampling of unfiltered information, the actual decision process becomes impossibly confused. When we cannot analyze or even identify exactly what went wrong, we cannot learn from mistakes and im- prove. This may not seem to be a problem when the market is in a generous and it is easy to make money, but when the hard times come as always do hazard, untested approach quickly becomes a serious hazard to wealth. Back-testing Technical Market Indicators provides practical alternatives that fer much better probabilities of success. A tested, objective and systematic strategy does not rely on forecasts O subjective judgments, and it leaves no room for work O doubt: Instead, it offers a precise set of instructions that tightly control in- vestment risks while allowing maximum profits to accumulate. Moreover; by testing substantial historical data covering many market cycles, we can design a model to maximize reward and risk tradeoffs in all kinds of market environments. Types of Technical Market Indicators: Trend, Momentum; Sentiment Early technicians observed and catalogued all kinds of transaction data. In time, repetitive patterns were identified and general theories emerged. Trend (price move- ment: up, down; or sideways) emerged as the primary consideration in technical analysis. Momentum (price velocity, Or rate of change of price movement) is a leading in- dicator of a change in price trend direction. Momentum change usually precedes trend change. In typical major market cycle, begins a new uptrend with very they system past. mood they hap- of- guess - price price 8 Evaluating Technical Market Indicators high and rising momentum, the signal for a new bull market: Over the next months to years, this positive velocity gradually diminishes, and the slope of the price advance lessens. Usually, momentum hits its peak well before the price hits its ultimate high. Then, velocity gradually tapers off as price begins to make little upward progress on rally attempts. Momentum pattern of decreasing peaks aS price rallies to Or slightly beyond previous peaks This is known as negative divergence. The end of the bull market is at hand when begins to fall short of previous peaks on minor attempts ~a clear evidence of bullish exhaustion. When drops below previous minor lows and momentum breaks sharply into negative territory, it is the beginning of the downward part of the cycle, the bear market Finally, after a decline, velocity bottoms out before actual hits its ultimate low. Gradually, veloc - ity becomes less and less negative on minor declines. Price may make a lower low; but momentum is not as negative as it was previously at higher lows, and that is called positive divergence. As negative momentum diminishes, the stage is be- set for a new upward cycle. Finally, likely following one O many tests of the or prolonged period of dull, sideways price fluctuation at depressed levels, price breaks to a new multi-month high on volume and high price velocity to signal a new bull market: This full cycle repeats endlessly: Basic chart analysis is supplemented by a variety of statistical formulas known as Indicators: (The ticker tape is the streaming, almost real-time report each stock transaction in sequence on the floor of the stock exchange.

Introducing Technical Market Indicators 9 Criteria for Judging Technical Market Indicators, Trading Systems, Investment Timing Models Percentage  accuracy (profitable trades to total trades) is an obsession of novice traders, but it is not a very important criterion for judging a trading system. Some highly effective technical timing models are wrong more often than are right, while some marginal models are right more often than are wrong: The performance measure is the ratio of total net to maximum equity drawdown, also known as the reward/risk ratio. Maximum equity drawdown deter- mines the practical workability of a strategy. A model that sustains large losses is not practical, even if total profits are high in the end. Maximum equity drawdown is the largest overall downtrend in capital from to trough. Maximum equity drawdown is not just the largest cumulative loss of consecutive losing trades, since bad performance period could be interrupted by a small profit; only to be followed by a resumption of the cumulative net equity down- trend to a still lower low. The best and simplest way to grasp reward versus risk is to visually inspect the graph of Cumulative Equity: Large equity drawdowns become obvious on a chart. If these drawdowns are severe when compared to the drawdowns of other indicators; we should discard that trading system and choose an alternative strategy: There are many other performance measures, some of which involve extremely complex statistical manipulations, but these do not tell us as much as the chart of Cu- mulative Equity. Keep it simple" is still the best advice. they they key profit- peak Chapter 2 Walk-Forward Simulation of Technical Market Indicators Offers the Potential for Consistent Profits Through Time Simulation, or historical back-testing, is one of the most powerful analytical tech- niques ever devised. It is a crucial step in effective market strategies Through simulation; we can isolate timing models that would have been consistently profitable over actual past market history. Powerful computers, specialized software, and reli- able historical data make simulation increasingly accessible. Simulation is much more sensible than the alternatives: using untested decision- making models Or using systems that would have failed to produce consistent profits in the past.  Yet critics point out that future market behavioral patterns may not match those of the past: True, but perfect match-upS are not necessary A worthwhile advan- tage may be gained by quantifying imperfect similarities, patterns, O tendencies If a market is a manifestation of human crowd psychology, and if mass human behavior has some underlying order and characteristic repetitive patterns, then effective his- torical testing may find these patterns. The correct way to test Technical Market Indicators is to use walk-forward, blind simulation, also known as ex-ante cross validation. This is an orderly, atic procedure for realistically testing hypothesis that can be performed in nine steps. Nine Steps to Walk-Forward Simulation of Technical Market Indicators 1. Form Hypothesis.  Start   with reasonable hypothesis about market be- havior; one well-founded in logic and observation. There are more than a hundred   promising and   clearly defined   hypotheses   (Technical  Market Indicators  to choose from in this book: 2_ Get Data: We acquire the largest quantity of accurate historical data on a tradable financial instrument of interest that we can find. The more data, the greater the significance of our test results_ 10 finding system- Walk-Forward Simulation of Technical Market Indicators Offers the Potential For Consistent Profits Through Time 11 3. Check Data: We carefully examine our data to insure its accuracy. The eas- iest way to check data is to chart it and then look for outliers, O odd excur- sions. Also, systematically spot check the rest of our data against an independent data source. Accurate data is essential for testing indicators 4 Segment Data. Divide the database into reasonable fixed-length time inter- vals, such as years, quarters, months The initial data segment should be longer than the rest. 5_ Optimize. Load the earliest data segment, and then find the specific para- meter that would have maximized reward/risk performance. Optimization, which is also known as curve-fitting, is the systematic search for the best specific indicator parameter best in the sense that this parameter would have produced the highest and most consistent net profit relative to the worst peak-to-trough drawdown in cumulative equity. The best parameter for the oldest data segment is found through brute-force number crunching: we sys- tematically vary the values of the parameter in our selected indicator formula in order to identify which specific constant would have produced the highest returns relative t0 risks of We strictly limit our optimization to the ear- liest data segment in order to avoid over curve-fitting: The earliest data ment we use to find our best specific parameter is known aS seen data (or in-Sample data) , while later and more recent data segments not yet used are known as unseen data (or out-of-sample data). We hold back the more recent unseen data segments for walk-forward simulation (Step 6). Here in 5_ we make note of which specific parameter would have produced the reward/risk performance, but we do not record any performance data based on seen data: Rather; only performance data based on unseen data can be counted in our walk-forward simulation performance evaluation (in 9). 6_ Walk Forward. This newly discovered, optimal indicator parameter (from 5) is projected forward in time onto the next and more recent segment of out-of-sample, unseen data that was not included in the brute-force opti- mization search: We record the performance data for this simulation for eval- uation (in 9). 7_ Add. We add the data segment we just used for our walk-forward simulation (Step 6) to our previously seen database (from 5) . After each walk- forward step, our seen database grows and our unseen database shrinks. 8_ Repeat the cyclical pattern established in Steps 5, 6, and 7 until we use all unseen data. We start the Step 5 optimization process again, with the just-seen data (from Step 6) now included in a larger seen database we use for optimization in 5.After rerunning the Step 5 optimization, use the resulting newly found best parameter to walk forward (Step 6) on the next segment of unseen data. Then we add back that just-seen data (just used we loss. seg- Step optimal Step Step Step Step Step we 12 Evaluating Technical Market Indicators in to the seen optimization database (from 5), which grows larger with every repetition: We repeat this loop, performing 5, 6, and 7 over and over until we walk forward over all unseen data, bringing us to the current moment in time. This may seem like work, but it is ex- tremely quick and easy compared to judging an indicator in real-time, one at a time. 9_ Evaluate Results. If we have acquired enough clean (accurate data, and if we have broken that data into enough segments, we have gained realistic perspective on how our   indicator  would have evolved and   performed through many iterations over the We have seen whether or not our in- dicator would have been sound and consistent through past time. We can now compare the simulated results of a variety of indicators so that we can select the best indicators for real-time application: We have an objective ba- sis to accept O reject our indicator hypothesis. If our simulated test results on unseen data are acceptable, we run final opti- mization on all available data to establish an indicator parameter to use going forward in real-time. Note that if we skip ahead to this point without performing all Nine to Walk-Forward Simulation, we deprive ourselves of a realistic perspective of our in- dicator' $ strengths, weaknesses, and evolution over time, and we will not be able to feel the same level of confidence in our indicator as we would feel if we worked through all Nine We may retain in our seen database all of our previously seen data, no matter how old it is. Human beings make markets, and basic human nature does not change much over the years. So, old data may not be obsolete, and old historical patterns cre- ated by crowd psychology may reappear Alternately, we could allow for faster evolution of our decision rule over time by systematically deleting some predefined quantity of the very oldest seen data as an quantity of new unseen data is added to the optimization database. In other words, we could use a moving time window of predefined length to determine our specific parameters. If there is a reason to believe that the basic nature of a mar- ket may have changed over time, we would be justified in systematically deleting the oldest time segments of historical data. This simulation process imposes the rigor of the scientific method on technical analysis theories. If our indicator developed on seen data produces consistent and rel- atively strong performance when projected forward onto future periods unseen data, then we have a reasonable justification to use this indicator going forward into the unseen future immediately ahead. Obviously; it is far better to find out if Our indicator is effective Or inadequate in simulation, rather than finding out in real time with real money. And we benefit whether Step Step Steps again day years.

As Thomas Edison pointed out, a rejected hypothesis is very useful information that allows uS to turn our resources t0 other approaches that may produce better results. The process of the research often re- wards us with more realistic insights into market behavior and inspires new ideas. Specific Example of a Walk-Forward Simulation of a Simple Technical Indicator: The Evolving Exponential Moving Average Crossover Strategy The Evolving Exponential Moving Average Crossover Strategy is one of the simplest trend-following Technical Market Indicators We choose exponential moving aver- ages crossovers for this demonstration because of their simplicity and attractive the- oretical and practical advantages We prefer exponential smoothing as moving average method because it is more responsive to newer data and less dependent on older data than simple moving averages. Also, exponential smoothing is less sensitive to newer data and less dependent on older data than weighted moving averages. Com- to other methods, exponential smoothing is more stable This strategy buys and covers short when price crosses above its own exponential moving average, and then it sells and sells short when price crosses under its own trailing exponential moving average. In this example, using weekly data, if this Friday'$ closing price is above the previous week's exponential moving average, we the Dow-Jones Industrial Average at this Friday' $ close. On the other hand, if the most recent end-of-week price is below last week's expo- nential moving average, sell our long position and also sell short the Dow-Jones Industrial Average. This strategy is always in the market, either or short. The clearly and precisely defined buy and sell signals leave absolutely no room for un- certainty, subjective judgment, Or interpretation, which can be sources of problems Moving average smoothing is the basis of many trend-following approaches and sys- tems, and our unqualified crossover rule is its simplest form_ Avoid hindsight bias. We go both long and short because we must be very care- ful not to inadvertently introduce a bullish bias, which is a common but incorrect un- spoken assumption of those who choose a long or cash strategy without selling short. It is only obvious in hindsight that the stock market has had a strong bullish (upward) bias over the past century; but that information was not at all available a century ago. Note that a random long Or short strategy would have lost very substantially on the short side, due to the market'$ unusual uptrend from years 1982 to 2000. So, a and short strategy is a test, since any indicator that survives equal-opportunity short selling and still performs strongly has to be The only parameter that can be varied is the period length, n. With such a simple, unbiased approach, there is oly one parameter (variable) to optimize: the number of time periods (in this case, the number of weeks) used to estimate our doing pared long trail- long ing buy long we long long good good. 14 Evaluating Technical Market Indicators exponential smoothing constant: To translate the number of time periods into an ex- ponential smoothing constant; use the formula 2/(n+1), where n represents the num- ber of time periods. The greater n: the greater the number of time periods, the greater the length of the exponential moving average, the more loosely the exponential moving average follows the raw data, the longer the lag time in following the raw data, the lower the sensitivity of the decision rule, the smaller the number of and sell signals, the greater the tolerance for random movement without triggering a trade signal, and the greater the change required to signal a change in existing long Or short positions n means slow; insensitive, and inactive indicator that generates few signals. The smaller n: the smaller the number of time periods, the smaller the length of the exponential moving average, the more tightly the exponential moving average follows the raw data, the shorter the time in following the raw data, the higher the sensitivity of the decision rule, the greater the number of buy and sell signals, the smaller the tolerance for random movement without triggering a trade signal, and the smaller the change required to signal a change in existing or short positions small n means sensitive, and active indicator that generates many trad- signals. Transaction costs, dividends, margin, and interest can vary substantially and com- plicate the analysis. These costs are not included in this example, solely in the interest of simplicity of presentation; and not at all because are insignificant in reality: On the contrary, these deserve careful consideration when choosing an investment strategy: The more frequent the trading signals, the greater the transaction costs, which not only include commissions but also slippage the price you actually receive on an order compared to the price you hoped to receive. Slippage can be highly variable, and it can exceed the bid-ask spread, especially in fast markets. Slippage is usually a negative number; and therefore a cost. Because margin and leverage can greatly magnify profits and losses, are another major consideration: buy price large trading lag price long fast, ing they they Walk-Forward Simulation of Technical Market Indicators Offers the Potential For Consistent Profits Through Time 15 Example of Using the Nine to Walk-Forward Simulation on the Dow-Jones Industrial Average 1. Form Hypothesis. We choose a one-parameter (period length) Exponential Moving Average Crossover Strategy 2 Get Data. We acquire historical data on the Dow-Jones Industrial Average back to 1900 from UST Securities. (This data also is available from other sources. To simplify our work for this example, we sample end-of-week data only: 3_ Check Data: We carefully examine data to insure its accuracy, by visual in- spection of the chart looking for outliers (odd excursions) and by systematic checks. We correct any data errors_ 4 Segment the Data: We choose to segment the data into 1-year time intervals, from January 1 to December 31 each year: Therefore, will walk forward by one year at a time, and our seen database will grow in size by 52 Friday closing each year;  while our unseen database available for future walk-forward simulation will shrink by 52 Friday closing prices each year: We select 16 years of weekly closing from January 1, 1900 to Decem- ber 31, 1915 for our initial (earliest) data segment: This initial segment must include a minimum of 30 trades and cover an integer multiple of a full low frequency (for example, the well-known 4-year cycle) in order to elim- inate a or sell bias. Two 4-year are eight years, and two 8-year cy- cles are 16 years (See Cycles: , 5_ Optimize. We conduct a brute-force optimization 0 OUT initial segment of data (the 16 years of weekly closes) , systematically trying all Expo- nential Moving Average lengths from week to 50 weeks We make note of which parameter would have produced the best reward/risk perfor- mance results.

We add that just-simulated data from 6 to the previously mized, seen database (from 5), so our original 16 years of weekly price closes is now 17 years. We retain all the old seen data in Our optimization database, never deleting any seen data from Our ever-growing optimization database, even as we add new, just-seen data each year: The length in years of our optimization database will grow from 16 years, to 17 years, to 18, to 19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26 and so on to the end of all our data.

We evaluate the cumulative results of our walk-forward simulation performed on unseen data only: This will provide us with a real- istic perspective on how our method would have evolved and performed in real-time through many iterations over the This walk-forward simulation, year by year; will allow our optimized indicator parameter to adapt over time to any possible evolutionary change in the market'$ rhythms. We carefully record the profits and losses of each walk-forward sim- ulation on unseen data each year so that we can build a realistic, simulated cumula- tive track record of the performance results of our indicator over time. At this point, we have selected our hypothesis, acquired our data, thoroughly checked our data, segmented our data, and are now ready for OUr next step, 5, Optimize. 5. Optimize. We systematically try every exponential moving average period length from 1 to 50 against the weekly closing prices for the first 16 years of the century. We find that all the period lengths tested would have been profitable. The maximum would have been recorded by the 4-week ex- ponential moving average crossover: 6_ Walk Forward. We measure the simulated performance of this 4-week ex- ponential moving average crossover strategy over the next 52 weeks of un- seen data, from January 1, 1916, through December 31,1916. We record the result for future evaluation (in 9). 7_ Add: We add that just-simulated data (from Step 6, data for January 1, 1916, through December 31, 1916) to our previously optimized, seen database (from 5) , such that our original 16 years of weekly closes is now 17 years_ 8_ Repeat: We repeat Steps 5, 6,and 7. 5. Optimize. We apply systematic brute-force number crunching to 17 years of data (now from January 1, 1900 through December 31, 1916).

Each yearend from December 1915 to December 1936, we find the same result: all the period lengths tested would have been profitable, and maximum would have been recorded with a 4-week exponential mov- average crossover strategy: 6_ Walk Forward. Since with the addition of all 22 1-year increments the ex- ponential moving average period length remained unchanged at 4 weeks, we can summarize the walk-forward simulation results in Chart ] as one contin- uous Cumulative Equity Line from 12/31/15 to 12/31/37. The real-time sim - ulated for this 22-year would have been 52.52% annually. Total simulated profit would have been 11569, which would have been 32.1 times the maximum drawdown of 369. Maximum drawdown is the worst-case scenario we would suffer if we started trading our strategy at the worst pOS- sible time; that is, if we started at a peak in the Cumulative Equity Line just before the beginning of the worst cumulative loss periods. Only 399 or 115 of the 294 total number trades would have been profitable, which is fairly typical of long-term trend-following strategies; however; the would have been bigger than the losses. Note the drop in the Equity Line at the end of 1937. Such a large decline in Equity can be taken as hint that the exponential moving average that fit the mar- ket's behavior so well in the past might need to be updated. In actual practice, when- ever we see such an equity can take it as a message from the market to rerun our Step 5 Optimization to see if anything has changed even if such an optimization is not yet "scheduled" by our predefined procedure. 7_ Add: We add simulated data (from 6) to OUT previously optimized, seen database (from 5). That is, to prepare for our next routine brute-force optimization (Step 5), according to our predefined procedure, we load all data from January 1, 1900 through December 31, 1937. All that seen data al- ready has been used either in OUT previous year-end optimizations O; in the case of data for 1937,in our most recent 52-week, walk-forward simulation. 8_ Repeat: We repeat 5, 6, and 7_ end. profit ing profit _ period gains sharp drop;` we Step Step again Steps Walk-Forward Simulation of Technical Market Indicators Offers the Potential For Consistent Profits Through Time 19 5. Optimize. Repeating this longer new 38-year brute-force optimization prO- vides us with our first change of period length in our whole 22 years of sim- ulated, real-time experience: the best reward/risk performance now would have been recorded by the 17-week exponential moving average crossover rule. Note that although this back-search for an optimal length has found a new length of 17 weeks as of December 31, 1937, this new parameter does not change our simulated track record over the 22 years of real-time simulation. That simulated performance is recorded separately in an entirely separate step, 6, Walk Forward: Our simulated track record of the past stands as is and cannot be revised, no matter what back-search optimizations may reveal: We take care to separate "the from "the future. 6_ Walk Forward. The important question remains: How well might this new optimized decision rule perform in the future, over the next year of fresh, new; untested, untouched, unknown unseen data? For the answer; we project our walk-forward simulation ahead onto the next 52 weeks of unseen data. We load unseen data from 1/1/38 to 12/31/38, apply the 17-week exponen- tial moving average crossover strategy to this unseen data, then carefully record the results_ 7_ Add.

Each time, we find that all the lengths in the optimization would have been profitable, and maximum profit would have been recorded every year with the same 17-week exponential moving average crossover strategy: 6_ Walk Forward: Since over all 54 of these 1-year increments the exponential moving average period length remains unchanged at 17 weeks, we can show the walk-forward simulation results in Chart 2 as one continuous Cumulative Equity Line from 12/31/37 to 12/31/92. The real-time simulated profit for this period would have been 10.589 annually: Total simulated profit would have been 582%, which would have been 14.6 times the maximum draw- down of 40%. (Maximum drawdown is the worst-case scenario we would suffer if we started trading our strategy at the worst possible time.) Only 29% Or 107 of the 375 total number trades would have been profitable. 7_ Add. We add back all simulated data to our previously optimized, seen database. 5. Optimize.

In prolonged and deep bear market, like 1929-1932, the popular buy-and-hold strategy would lose substantially, while a or short exponential moving average crossover strategy would offer the possibility of significant short side profits. A brute-force optimization number crunching of all the available data from 1900 to 1998 yields some interesting additional findings Over that 98.8 years, crossover signals for all exponential moving average lengths between 1 and 100 weeks would have been profitable. The fact that all would have been profitable suggests the IO- bustness of the basic trend-following concept; one that is well established in techni- cal analysis. In addition, all exponential moving average lengths from 10 to 50 weeks would have outperformed the buy-and-hold strategy: The profitability of the best per- forming exponential moving average of 40 weeks in length would have beaten the buy-and-hold strategy by more than six to one, while suffering much less risk: The 40-week exponential moving average crossover strategy maximum drawdown would have been 44% smaller than the buy-and-hold drawdown That is worthwhile re- duction in risk: Even the best 40-week exponential moving average crossover strategy would have been wrong on 72% of its transactions. But the bottom line shows that; in this case at least; "often wrong but never in doubt" can be a virtue, because we automati- cally cut our losses and let our profits run: We avoid confusion, indecision, hesitation, and anxiety We always know precisely what action to take and when to take it. We always know exactly what our position in the market should be, according to our en- tirely objective, unemotional, unbiased, predetermined formula. These are worth - while benefits. With one eye steadily fixed on the rear view mirror; most investors avoid the short side. For 60 years, from 1938 to 1998, short selling would have lost money US- the Evolving Exponential Moving Average Crossover Strategy: The number of transactions could have been cut in half and profits could have been larger by totally ignoring the short side. But; that is precisely the kind of hindsight over-fitting we should avoid. Unbi- ased objectivity requires both buying long and selling short: That is why all of our tests of the Evolving Exponential Moving Average Crossover Strategy assumed un- biased buying and short selling: either we were 100% invested on the long side in the DJIA, or we were 100% short: Take care that bias does not creep into your re- search when you are not thinking; Summary and Conclusions about Walk-Forward Simulation It may seem to be only common sense that the most rational approach to forecasting the future requires a careful study of the past. However; this historical testing proce- dure remains underutilized by the great majority of investors. price long ing long 26 Evaluating Technical Market Indicators There is no assurance that future results will resemble past performance, of course. Nevertheless, correctly performed, walk-forward simulation offers a logical, consistent, and totally objective approach for selecting effective decision rules and practical investment strategies. Both logic and experience suggest that this approach offers a reasonably chance of future success. Besides, there is no other alter- native for selecting investment strategy that is so firmly grounded in actual market behavior: It bears repeating that we should test substantial quantities of historical data that cover all kinds of market environments. Also, we should against excessive curve fitting that involves too many conditions O rules O, worse, biased Or condi- tional rules designed with hindsight for the sole conscious or unconscious purpose of filtering out a specific bad period. We should make certain that our research is truly blind, honest, and objective. Complexity makes our research difficult to comprehend. Keeping it simple helps uS understand and have confidence in our indicator This highly simplified demonstration is strictly for educational purposes and is not a recommendation of any particular trading strategy. It is intended to show to simulate  real-world  experience with clearly  defined walk-forward simulation method. The example and assumptions were purposely simplified to a bare minimum for the sake of clarity To be more realistic, transactions costs, which were not re- flected in these numbers, must be subtracted from simulated profits. Also, better sim- ulated results could have been obtained using daily instead of weekly data sampling: good guard how Chapter 3 Finding a Technical Market Indicator That Is Right for You There are hundreds of Technical Market Indicators, trading systems, investment tim- ing models, and other strategies. Some are effective, while others are not: How can we tell the difference? How can we select a method without risking capital? How and when might we use the best indicators? How can we make our own? How can we avoid common mistakes? How can we identify and steer clear of flawed ideas? How can we separate the wheat from the chaff, fact from fiction, myth from re- ality? How can we find appropriate tools for different market environments and dif- ferent investment objectives? The best answer to all these questions is walk-forward simulation based o ac- tual historical market data. (See Chapter 2.) With simulation; we can develop and test a precise set of trading rules to deal with all kinds of market behavior-rules that leave no room for uncertainty Or confusion: We can find specific decision rules that would have maximized profit and minimized risk of significant loss in the past. By testing our ideas in all kinds of market conditions, we can uncover the vitally important in- formation we need about the nature of markets and trading methods. And with this knowledge, we can trade with confidence. Confidence makes the difference in how we are able to trade, not as weak hands, battered about by our own very human emo- tions of and fear; but as strong hands, acting boldly and calmly based on solid knowledge of verifiable facts established on actual market behavior: Six Common Errors to Avoid Many investment ideas are logically flawed from their conception. Logic and com- mon sense can save time and effort: There are six common errors that can be easily avoided. 1. Avoid indicators that signal twice based on the same data, once when new data enters the calculation and once when that same data drops out of 27 really system greed again 28 Evaluating Technical Market Indicators the moving window of the calculation Stochastics, Rate-of-Change, Momentum, even Simple Moving Averages (particularly the fast; sensitive ones) all signal twice, particularly when the data entering and exiting the moving time window represents a change. Obviously, the market does not care about our SO-called take-away number; o drop-off number; the stale data passed by the moving time window The market looks ahead, not behind: indicator that responds to stale data from the past will introduce random errors into our analysis. We need to be independent of old data and on the forward edge with fresh data representing the latest realities in the marketplace. 2_ Be aware of structural changes in market over time. In the equity markets, odd-lot trading data has not been the same since options became Also, Specialist and Member Short Sales ratios do not match the levels of several years ago. There are substantially greater numbers of issues traded today than there were several decades ago, destroying the comparability over time of the advance-decline line, new highs-new lows and volume This data needs to be statistically normalized, but all too commonly it is not. Rather than working with absolute indicator levels, try reworking the indicator into various ratios, such as advances minus declines divided by total issues traded. Also, try deviation from trend ratio: divide the current indicator level by its own trailing I-year or half-year moving average. Often, these variations will normalize an indicator s0 that it appears more stable over time 3. Avoid working with dollars O points after a big price move_ Use percentage changes instead. For example, 100-point movements in a single day for the Dow-Jones Industrial Average have been quite common since 1997, but 100-point days were totally unheard of 10 years previous, before 1987. It would be a serious mistake to compare Momentum (generally defined as to- day'$ close minus the close n-days ago) levels now to Momentum levels years ago when the Dow was much lower: are not comparable. Of course momentum readings are more extreme now, both higher and lower; expressed in price Or index points, because absolute price index levels are so much higher: Working with dollar O point differences, rather than with ratios or percentages, destroys comparability over time, making it impossible to compare accurately today's behavior with past behavior: 4 Avoid too much complexity and curve A model with many parts, sev- eral different types of data, and several different methods of calculation is hard, if not impossible, to comprehend. If we cannot comprehend our indi- cator; we will not be confident enough to execute its signals in times of un- certainty, confusion, anxiety, and high stress. By adding curve fitting on period. big being Any popular: price They fitting: top Finding a Technical Market Indicator That Is Right for You 29 of complexity, the practical value of any statistical model will collapse. Overly complex and overly processed models have poor records in real time. 5. Do not expect experience to be a or kind teacher: In the market; the old saying; "Experience is the best teacher; is not true. Experience is knowledge learned too late. Experience is what you get when you don 't get what you want. Learning from actual experience has substantial disadvantages. rience is tOo often unsystematic, even haphazard, and all but impossible to learn from. Without sufficient knowledge going in, unstructured trading can be overwhelmingly confusing in real-time, with ever-changing distractions, including events, opinions, and moment to moment fluctuations. Mak- matters worse, our own emotional reactions color and distort our percep- tions of objective reality. Even if we could learn from experience, experience takes forever: It takes too many years to see the markets in all their phases At best, experience is an inefficient way to collect data and formulate decision rules. decisions in trading and investing can be extremely expensive. It is far less costly to simulate experience through historical back- testing than to attempt to acquire experience slowly and painfully in real- time_ 6_ Avoid "Trader s Hell:' We must make certain than our trading rules cover all bases, leaving no gaps that can turn into yawning chasms of uncertainty, in- decision, hesitation, and dysfunctional emotional excesses. We need to know at all times exactly what we must do to take the kind of timely and effective actions that lead to success in trading and investing: Do Your Own Work: Generate Your Own Decisions Based on What You Know Take the time to determine appropriate, realistic objectives that are right for you: One size does not fit all. The best trading system for a well-capitalized, unleveraged term investor seeking to maximize profits from riding long-term trends is very differ- ent from the best trading system for an undercapitalized, highly leveraged speculator hoping to scalp modest profits with minimal risk The trend-following big investor can tolerate the significant equity drawdowns associated with Secondary Reactions against the long-term Major Trend. On the other hand, the small trader trying to from the waves and ripples in needs a sensitive, short-term trading system that tightly controls equity drawdowns while offering consistent profitability: Both big investors and small traders need to take the real costs of trading into account: Sophisticated big investors try to keep costs down by not trying to catch every wave. Many try to minimize their trading: worry about market impact, good Expe- price ing many Wrong long- profit prices They 30 Evaluating Technical Market Indicators when the size of their transactions moves prices away from them. Impact can be min- imized by timing transactions contrary to the minor ripples: buying dips when most traders   are cutting losses and dumping positions, and selling rallies when many traders are chasing prices up with market orders to Trading the same way as the majority, trend chasing, assures the worst fills possible. For the novice small trader; transactions costs come aS big shock_beginners cannot possibly imagine how seemingly small commissions and slippage can eat up equity. We all must learn to control our trading, not to overtrade, to wait for opportu- nities, and not to act impulsively at the wrong time. A thorough understanding of trad- systems, real-time executions, and computer simulation can provide the facts needed by both investors and traders. The long-term trend follower is well equipped to capitalize on big trends that develop gradually over substantial periods of time. This is not such a hard to do since the Major Trend is usually obvious to anyone with a long-term chart and a basic book on technical analysis. The short-term trader has more of a challenge. He is subject to the sudden shifts in crowd psychology that frequently occur; seemingly for no reason. He also will be caught by unforeseeable information events, changing expectations, and rumors_ These strike without warning, making the results of systems tailored to the very short-term hit-and-miss. Because profits can vanish swiftly in the short-term; the short-term trader tends to take profits quickly before go away: It feels to be right and ring the cash register: But that cuts the probability of big On the other hand, the deep-seated psychological drive not to be and to fall into denial when we are wrong, too often tends to make short-term discretionary traders carry positions longer than should: As rule of thumb, tolerated losses only get worse. And the longer the losses are tolerated, the worse Short-term trading offers challenge and action and a chance to make something from practically nothing, quickly Therefore, there will always be a market for short- term trading systems. If we want to be successful, we must study and learn and do our own work: We cannot simply someone else's black box system (a system in which the decision rules are not disclosed) because we cannot develop enough confidence in it to follow it when uncertainty; stress, and losses mount: Unless we thoroughly understand and believe in it; the best black box trading system in the world is of little value to us In contrast; a system that we deeply understand and have tested ourselves over substan - tial actual history would be much more useful to US, even if it is actually less effective than another system that we do not thoroughly understand and believe in. Confidence makes the difference.

The cause of their problems cannot even be identified in hindsight because of their hazard decision-making process. They learn nothing from their experience. To function effectively on the firing line, amid all the confusion and noise, we must generate OUT own plan of action while shutting out all external opinions, advice, rumors, news reports, and other harmful noise. When we feel like asking someone else what is going on or what we should do, that is a indication that we have be- come confused and lost our discipline. We must immediately close out our positions and systematically analyze what has gone wrong: Unless we internalize our trading strategy based on well-tested Technical Market Indicator signals, our strategy does not really belong to us, and it will not be there for uS when we need it Walk-forward historical simulation and systematic execution of tested Techni- cal Market Indicator signals offer an orderly way to quantify and apply the lessons given by actual past market behavior: We know precisely what would have worked and what would not have worked. We can move forward into the future with confi- dence based on this knowledge.

mathematical solution is common to all types of decision-making situations: 1. Establish the criterion to be used (for example, maximize profits relative to risks). 2 Select a set of alternatives for consideration. 3 . Determine the model to be and the values of the parameters of the process_ 4 Determine which alternative optimizes the criterion established in 1. Critical variables are combined in a logical manner to form a model of the ac- tual problem. A model is a simplified representation of an empirical situation. Ideally, it strips a natural phenomenon of its bewildering complexity and duplicates the es- sential behavior of the natural phenomenon with a few variables, simply related. The simpler the model, the better it is, as as the model serves as reasonably reliable counterpart of the empirical problem: A simple model is: Economical of time and thought Readily understood by the decision maker: Capable of being modified quickly and effectively when necessary: The object is not to construct model that is as close as possible to reality in every respect: Such a model would require an excessive length of time to construct, and then it might be beyond human comprehension. Rather; we want the simplest model that predicts outcomes reasonably well and is consistent with effective action. If our variables can be quantified, then mathematics facilitates the decision- process. Mathematics is an inherently rigorous discipline that ensures an orderly procedure. We must be specific about what variables we select and what relationships we assume to exist among them. Mathematics is a powerful technique 36 Say used Step long making What Others about Technical Market Indicators, Models, and Trading Systems 37 for relating variables and for deriving logical conclusions from given premises. Math- ematics and computers make it possible to handle problems of great complexity: Solving model means obtaining logical conclusions.

Earle In finance and economics, controlled experimental data cannot be generated in a lab- oratory, and formal theoretical models have not proved to be effective for practical in- vestment application. Therefore, our only practical alternative for developing useable investment decision rules is historical data testing using statistical standards for vali- dation. Empirical modeling scientific methods to investment decision making: We need not be concerned about complex causes and effects; we simply test the sta- tistical correlation between observed events_ With empirical modeling, we identify events that are related to other events in a way that makes sense and is effective for practical investment application: Modeling with pattern recognition decision rules is a practical application of empirical modeling: We relate patterns in an indicator data series to patterns in a forecast data series. We look for quantifiable correlation using time series data from the past. We discover patterns by observing changes in the indicator data series that occur at about the same time as the events that we want to predict: We test any indicator data that we think might be reasonably relevant: We test our decision rules over long histories, so that we can ascertain sta- tistical validity to accept  reject indicators_ We base our acceptance criteria on the degree of statistical reliability: When pattern recognition decision rule tested over a sufficiently long period of time consistently yields statistically significant results, it earns OUr confidence. We need to define our decision rules precisely, so that may be un- ambiguously by any user: Empirical models need to be objective, so that results can be duplicated independently when the decision rules are applied to the same histori- cal time series data: There are six phases of research that are general to all types of mathematical modeling: Say applies they applied 38 Evaluating Technical Market Indicators 1. Formulating the problem: 2. Collecting the data series to be used for identifying patterns. 3 . Developing decision rules to identify patterns in the indicator series 4 Testing decision rules and evaluating the predictive results on the forecast series. 5. Establishing control over the use of the decision rules_ 6. Proceeding to implement the actual use of the decision rules. Each of these six phases consists of several steps that are subject to frequent reevaluation and reworking aS OuT research progresses. In investing, there are an infi- nite number of relationships from which to choose_ We narrow down relationships to test based on reason and common sense_ Our research process is facilitated by expe- rience with the empirical approach, familiarity with the variables, and the ability to identify odd or unexpected quirks in the data. We adapt future testing in light of feed- back from our past test results. Establishing controls over the use of the decision rules is necessary: No matter how well rules may work on historical data, rules may not work exactly the same way in the future. Relationships between variables are subject to change without notice. Therefore, we should establish guidelines in advance to tell us what to do in the event that our decision rules do not work aS expected. These guidelines should cover pro- tective closing of open positions whenever a specified, predetermined percentage loss is attained. Also, a pre-specified number of consecutive losing trades might trigger suspension of our decision rules until we can revise them to work successfully with both the original data and the new data.

The Cells Method of Indicator Evaluation: David R: Aronson The cells method for evaluating the utility of technical indicators is different from and complementary to the more common signal event method, which evaluates the net profit or loss that would have resulted over past data had we acted on the and sell signals. The cells method ranks and sorts historical data into cells (also known as bins Or ranges) in such a way that observations with similar indicator readings will be grouped together: Sorting observations into a typical ten cells, for example, the Say long long cycle buy cycle buy top 40 Evaluating Technical Market Indicators two cells will contain 209 of the total number of observations, those with the highest indicator readings; the middle six cells will contain 60% of the total number of ob- servations; and the lowest two cells will contain 20% of the total number of the ob- servations, those with the lowest indicator readings The cells method focuses directly on an indicator' $ ability to forecast future market changes rather than the profitability of trading signals derived from the indi- cator: Second, the cells method evaluates the predictive information content of an in- dicator over its entire range of possible values rather than oly at "signal event" points. Third, no buy/sell rules need to be defined to conduct cells method analysis This avoids the problem of overly complex rules. Fourth, since our analysis is no longer limited to specific action points, have a larger sample of data points. Fifth, the indicator is evaluated with respect to specific prediction horizon: For example, an indicator may be useful in forecasting the trend over the next 50 but useless for purposes of predicting it over the next 10 The cells method will reveal this. Typically, the analyst will examine an indicator with respect to a number of different horizons during the same analysis (for example, over the next 10, 20, 60, 120, and 250 days.) The cells method determines the predictive power of the indicator by measuring the degree of association between the indicator'$ current level and the subsequent per- centage change in the market. In other words, it discovers to what degree the market'$ future change depends upon O is predicted from the current level of the indicator: The cells method rates the strength of this dependence on a continuous scale anywhere from O% to 1OO%. A reading of 100% would imply the ability to predict perfectly, while 0% indicates total lack of predictive information. This is called variance reduction: Financial markets are too complex and too subject to random shocks to permit single indicator to contain high degrees of predictive power: Indicators typically score in the range of 0% to 10%, with many more scoring closer to zero than to 10. Achieving higher levels of variance reduction requires the proper integration of sev- eral complementary indicators into a multivariate model. A benefit of the cells method is that it permits ranked comparison of many indicators with respect to specific time horizons. This is important as the market analyst often has a whole library of indicators but lacks an objective way of comparing predictive power for short-term, intermediate-term; and long-term forecasting: To illustrate how the cells method is performed, we choose the New York Stock Exchange smoothed advanceldecline ratio (SADR) The ratio is defined as the net dif- ference between the number of stocks advancing and the number of stocks declining divided by total issues traded. We apply a 10-day exponential moving average to the erratic daily ratio. We select the 60-day future percent change in the Standard & Poor'$ we days; days. rating prime What Others about Technical Market Indicators, Models, and Trading Systems 41 500 Index (S&P 500) for our prediction horizon, our dependent variable. In the par- lance of statistical data analysis, this future change in the S&P 500 is known as the de- pendent variable. The implication of the word dependent is that the value of this variable depends to some degree on the current value of the indicator The variance re- duction provided by the cells method measures the strength of this dependence. Variance reduction is determined statistically from historical data. We sampled 5,354 days of historical data. Each of these past 5,354 observations was characterized by two pieces of information: the value of the SADR indicator on the given day and the value of the percent change in the S&P 500 over the following 60 Central to the cells method is the grouping of observations with similar indica- tor values into bins. There are an almost unlimited number of ways of grouping data, but one common way is based on deciles. Decile grouping creates 10 equally popu- lated cells, with 10% of the population in each cell. Since the number of cells created can influence the results of the analysis, it is recommended that a number of different cell structures be tried: Typically, the strongest indicators will rank well for a variety of cell resolutions. The grouping process begins by ranking all 5,354 days according to their SADR values. Those days in the top decile (the 535 with the highest SADR values  are placed in cell 10. Of the remaining 4,819 cases, those 535 with the next highest SADR readings are placed in cell 9_ Cell 8 gets the third highest SADR group. The process of grouping continues until the 535 observations with the lowest SADR read- are placed in cell 1. After all 5,354 observations have been placed in their proper cells based on the associated SADR value, the cells method turns its attention to the dependent variable, the market's future percentage change. First; a grand sample" dependent variable av- erage for all 5,354 observations is calculated. For the data set used in this analysis, for all 5,354 cases, the average 60-day percent change for the S&P 500 was +1.85% . This positive value merely reflects the long-term upward trend in stock since 1945. It so happens that this sample average can serve as the basis of a simplis- tic type of forecast; O naive prediction, which 0n any given day is history's best esti- mate of what the market is likely to do over the next 60 Next, the dependent variable average in each individual cell is calculated. In other words, an average dependent variable for just the 535 cases in cell 10 is calcu- lated. The same is done for cell 9, cell &, and so on until an average dependent able has been computed for each cell. The cases falling into cell 10 had an average dependent variable of +3.229. This means that all 535 cases qualifying for cell 10, the average 60-day future change in the S&P 500 was +3.22%. The cell dependent variable can serve as the ba- sis for a conditional forecast, which is conditioned on information other than the Say rating days. days ing prices grand days. vari- for 42 Evaluating Technical Market Indicators dependent variable average. In this case, the conditional forecast of +3.229 is higher than the naive forecast, which was +1.859, the dependent variable average. Whether or not conditional forecast is truly better than the naive forecast is de- termined by the variance reduction measure. A naive forecast is often more accurate than one based on an indicator; in which case the variance reduction is Zero Or ative number: Variance reduction is the degree to which the conditional prediction is less erroneous than the naive forecast. The higher the variance reduction, the higher the predictive information content will be. Variance reduction measures indicate how much less error-prone OUT predictions will be when using the dependent variable av- erage of each decile cell, as compared to the naive forecast: The definition of an indi- cator with predictive information is one that can provide more accurate forecasts than the naive forecast Care must be taken to against accidental variance reduction, which can be achieved by chance. The the number of indicators being tested, the greater this risk. Cross-validation and significance testing can minimize this risk Cross-validation involves breaking the data up into two independent sets for learning and testing: The learning set is used to derive the cell dependent variable values_ These values are then used to predict on the independent test set. In other words, require that the predictive power be found in two independent sets of data: Thus, indicators that look by chance on one set of data will be revealed as bo- gus when fail to predict well on the test set: Despite the inherent rigor of the cross-validation method, there is still a small probability of a bogus indicator doing well in both test and learning sets_ So, as an additional form of insurance, the variance reduction achieved by an indicator must exceed a threshold of significance. The threshold is derived by a complex statistical theory that calculates the amount of variance reduction that can be achieved by a use- less indicator by chance alone 5% of the time. Indicators that can pass these two tests are likely to contain valid predictive information. Informational synergy when indicators are permitted to act in concert, can be significant: Indicators that show no predictive power individually can, when properly combined, demonstrate a high level of predictive power: An entire branch of data analysis, known as multivariate analysis, is devoted to the discovery of such effects. Potential indicators can easily number in the thousands, and the process of reducing the candidate indicators to a manageable number is referred to as feature selection. Raden Research Group's EXAMINE program determined the variance reduc- tion of 284 indicators used to forecast the S&P 500. Each indicator was evaluated with respect to five different dependent variables, which were prediction time hori- zons: the percent change in the S&P 500 over the following 10, 20, 60,120, and 250 days. Results of this test suggest the following four indicators may contain useful predictive information: Change in the Slope of the Yield Curve; Smoothed Change in grand grand neg- guard larger we good they What Others about Technical Market Indicators, Models, and Trading Systems 43 Long-Term Government Bond Yields; Smoothed Change in 3-Month Treasury Bill Yields; and Smoothed Yield Curve Slope. In addition, Raden's analysis suggests that the longer time horizons were the most predictable: variance reductions of more than 10% were achieved for 120- and 250-day prediction, while the maximum variance re- ductions achieved for 10- and 20-day prediction was less than 39. Sixty-day fore- casting was the shortest horizon that seemed feasible with individual indicators. While time horizons of less than 120 are very difficult to forecast with single in- dicators, multiple indicators may be able to forecast short-term horizons to a mean- ingful degree. Long-term exponential smoothings (approximately equal to a 150-day simple moving average) produced better results than short-term smoothings in en- hancing the information of various indicators, even for short horizon prediction. Objective evaluation of an indicator' $ predictive power is crucial to the devel- opment of sound prediction systems This is best left to a computer programmed with rigorous data analysis methods, employing cross-validation and significance testing: Adapted with permission of the publisher; David R.

Say days This page intentionally left blank Part 2 Technical Market Indicators This page intentionally left blank Absolute Breadth Index 47 Absolute Breadth Index The Absolute Breadth Index is a modestly effective measure of stock price move- ment; regardless of direction, up Or down. This indicator was developed by Norman Fosback (The Institute for Econometric Research, 3471 North Federal Highway, Fort Lauderdale, FL 33306). The Absolute Breadth Index uses daily New York Stock Ex- change data: Weekly data, available in weekend news  sources, such as Barron' S, might also be employed. The Absolute Breadth Index is the absolute value of the number of advancing issues minus the number of declining issues. To make the data comparable over time, absolute difference must be divided by total issues traded. There was a 1080% increase in the number of stocks listed on the NYSE over 59 years, from a low of 303 total issues traded on 8/24/40 to a high of 3574 on 11/30/99. Such growth could distort the meaning of a breadth indicator over time, unless the technical analyst normalized the data: We can convert the data to percentage by dividing the ab- solute value of the number of net changed issues traded by the total number of is- sues traded, which is the sum of number of stocks ending the day higher; lower; and unchanged on any given day: The calculation may be expressed mathematically as follows: N = ((IA - DIJCA + D + U)) 100 where N = today's 1-day ratio of the absolute value of net changed issues traded t0 total issues traded A number of advancing issues D number of declining issues U = number of unchanged issues A + D + U = total number of issues traded each 100 = multiply by one hundred to convert a fractional ratio to a percentage Absolute value ignores either the plus o minus sign  So, for example, if the day'$ market movement is moderately bullish (with the number of advancing issues 1500 and the number of declining issues 1300) the Absolute Breadth Index numera- tor is 200. On the other hand, if the next day'$ market trend is reversed to moderately bearish (with the number of advancing issues 1300 and the number of declining is- sues 1500) the Absolute Breadth Index numerator still equals 200, because absolute value only counts the difference, without regard to whether the imbalance is to the ad- vancing or declining side. In contrast; most other breadth indicators assign a plus sign to advances and a minus sign to declines, and retain the sign: day they 48 Technical Market Indicators When the absolute difference between the number of advancing and declining stocks is relatively high, it shows that a large proportion of stocks are changed in Fosback's accurate observation behind the Absolute Breadth Index is that the market is more likely to be near a market bottom when the number of changed issues is high. Significant market price lows are often more extreme, more intensely emo- tional, with most stocks affected by general pessimism, fear; and forced selling to meet margin calls. The of most stocks are changing near market bottom. Conversely; when the absolute difference between the number of advancing and declining stocks is low, stocks must be unchanged. Significant market tops are more likely to be dull, slowly unfolding affairs, as ready cash reserves for buying stock are gradually drawn down until are eventually exhausted. Stock trends begin to stall out on an stock by stock basis, one by one, as the whole topping process stretches out over time. At the end of a bull market; as the bull becomes increasingly exhausted, demand and supply for stocks eventually reach equilibrium, and so more stocks are likely to end the unchanged. Indicator Strategy Example of the Absolute Breadth Index Based on a 68-year file of daily data for the number of shares advancing, declining and unchanged each on the New York Stock Exchange and the Dow-Jones In- dustrial Average since 1932, we found that extreme levels above and below a trailing 2-day exponential moving average would have produced a positive result on a purely mechanical signal basis with no subjectivity, no sophisticated technical analysis, and no judgement: Enter Long (Buy) at the current daily close of the Dow-Jones In- dustrial Average when the current Absolute Breadth Index is greater than its own previous day'$ 2-day exponential moving average plus 819. Close Long (Sell) at the current daily close of the Dow-Jones Indus- trial Average when the current Absolute Breadth Index today is less than its own previous day'$ exponential moving average minus 819.

The indicator was developed by Marc Chaikin (177 E. 77th Street, New York; NY 10021), and it is the basis for the Chaikin Oscillator; which measures weighted volume momentum: We illustrate this indicator daily data, although a similar Accumula- tion/Distribution line may be calculated on any time frame for which volume and prices (for high, low and last) are available from minutes to months The Accumulation/Distribution measures the position of the daily close within the daily price range, expressed as a fraction of that range. This fraction is mul- tiplied by total daily volume, and gives a quantification of net daily Accumulation (buying pressure identified by a plus sign, + ) or Distribution (selling pressure identi- fied by a minus sign; ~) These net daily pressures are cumulated into a running total and plotted as a line. A rising trend would be bullish; while a falling trend would be bearish: Mathematically, Accumulation/Distribution may be expressed as follows: AD cum((((C _ L) - (H - C)Y(H - L)) * V) where AD = the Accumulation/Distribution cumulative running total line. cum the abbreviation for "calculate a cumulative running total line. C = the daily closing H the daily high L = the daily low price. the daily total volume. Standard technical analysis tools may be on the cumulative Accumula- tion/Distribution line, including trendlines, recognition of higher highs and lower and divergence analysis as compared to the plain price chart. Accumulation/Distribution could also be compared to its own trailing moving aver- age to generate and sell signals.

Standard technical analysis tools may be used on the ASI, including trendlines, higher highs and lower and divergence analysis as compared to the plain price chart: ASI also could be compared to its own trailing moving average to generate and sell signals. Indicator Strategy Example for the Accumulation Swing Index (ASI) Historical data shows that the ASI can be an effective indicator on both the and short sides, but particularly on the long side. Based on the daily for the Dow- Jones Industrial Average for 72 years from 1928 to 2000, found that the following parameters would have produced a significantly positive result o a purely mechani- cal trend-following signal basis with no subjectivity, no sophisticated technical analy- sis, and no judgement: Enter Long (Buy) at the current daily price close of the Dow-Jones In- dustrial Average when the current ASI is greater than yesterday's 2-day ex- ponential moving average of ASI Close Long (Sell) at the current daily price close of the Dow-Jones Indus- trial Average when the current ASI is less than yesterday's 2-day exponen- tial moving average of ASI Enter Short (Sell Short) at the current daily price close of the Dow-Jones Industrial Average when the current ASI is less than yesterday's 2-day ex- ponential moving average of ASI: Close Short (Cover) at the current daily close of the Dow-Jones In- dustrial Average when the current ASI is greater than yesterday' $ ex- ponential moving average of ASI Starting with S1O0 and reinvesting profits, total net profits for this ASI strategy would have been S19,638,338, assuming a fully invested strategy, reinvestment of profits, no transactions costs and no taxes. This would have been 429,129.83 percent better than buy-and-hold.

In other words, in a steep and accelerating price trend, the exponential moving average period length grows shorter or more sensitive to new data entering the calculation. In a flattening price trend, the exponential moving average period length grows longer or less sensitive to new data entering the calculation. Although the Adaptive Moving Average is an interesting newer idea with con- siderable intellectual appeal, our preliminary tests fail to show any real practical ad- vantage to this more complex trend smoothing method. After all, the data that determines the smoothing constant is still the same old past data that is used for other smoothing method, so it is still looking into the rear-view mirror rather than into the ever unknowable future_ Also, it is normal and common for trends to pause and form minor continuation patterns, in which case an Adaptive Moving Average would be more likely to produce unprofitable whipsaws than a non- adaptive moving average. Finally, an Adaptive Moving Average is much more calcu- lation intensive so takes longer to compute, though this should become less of a consideration with ever faster computer hardware and software_ Advance/Decline Divergence Oscillator (ADDO) A popular method of interpreting the Advance-Decline Line is to visually compare it to a market price index, such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) For exam- ple, if the Advance-Decline Line enters a falling trend while the DJIA is still in a ris- trend, such negative divergence (sometimes) increases the probability of an eventual change to a bearish price trend, a move to the downside There is usually a variable lead time, and another risk in this type of visual analysis judgment call is that subjectivity could creep in. Arthur A. Merrill, CMT; created his Advance/Decline Divergence Oscillator (ADDO) to bypass this risk of subjectivity: He calculates and interprets ADDO in ten steps. 1. Convert daily breadth data to weekly data for all New York Stock Exchange issues in three sub-steps: sum the daily number of advancing issues for each of the week; separately, sum the number of declining issues; and sum the number of unchanged issues for each 2. Subtract the sum of declining issues from the sum of advancing issues Re- spect the sign: This is net advancing issues. any quite price steep ing day day: 60 Technical Market Indicators 3. Place that net difference in the numerator of weekly (A DJU ratio_ which is the net advancing issues divided by the number of unchanged is- sues_ Merrill credits Edmund Tabell for developing that indicator;, which gives emphasis to the level of the market's confidence (small unchanged) or indecisiveness (large unchanged). 4 Sum that weekly (A DJU ratio s values over the most recent trailing 52 weeks. This is a moving total of (A DJU. 5. Using the weekly closing price of the DJIA and the moving sum of (A DJU compute a linear regression of the two over the most recent 52 weeks. 6. Plot the regression line, with the DJIA on the Y axis and the moving sum of the (A DJU ratio on the X axis. 7 . To determine the expected value of the DJIA for a given value of the mov- ing sum (A DYU ratio, locate the point on the regression line that is di- rectly above the current (A DYU ratio value. 8. Express ADDO as the percentage deviation of the current closing of the DJIA minus its expected value. 9. Positive deviations of DJIA versus its expected value increase bearish prob- abilities for the future. 10. Negative deviations of DJIA versus its expected value increase bullish probabilities for the future: Advance-Decline Line, A-D Line The Cumulative Daily Advance-Decline Line, perhaps the most widely known mar- ket breadth indicator; traditionally has been used to spot divergences relative to a gen- eral market index, such as the S&P 500 or the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Most commonly; the Cumulative A-D Line is calculated as running total of daily net advancing minus declining stock issues on the New York Stock Exchange Similar indicators may be calculated for other markets, such as the NASDAQ, and weekly data also may be used. There are only two steps to compute this indicator: 1. From the number of advancing issues, subtract the number of declining is- sues each day, respecting sign: This is net advancing issues, and it is often a negative number: 2_ Add that daily advances-declines difference to a cumulative total of the daily net advancing issues This forms a continuous line that rises and falls with breadth trends on the NYSE: For example, our calculations for one month from August 8 to September &, 2000_ are shown. These calculations are anchored to starting value at the all-time low of the A-D Line on 12/24/74 set to zero.

Technical analysts have been aware that the most common subtraction cal- culation fails to compensate for a distortion that inflates the number of issues traded over the years, namely, the ever growing number of issues listed on the exchange. To regain analytical comparability over time, some analysts normalize the daily data, be- fore cumulating a running total, as follows: large long 62 Technical Market Indicators N = (A - DJCA + D) or T = (A - DY(A + D + U) where N = today' s 1-day ratio of net advances to total issues exhibiting any change at all number of advancing issues D = number of declining issues T = today' $ ratio of net advances to total issues traded U number of unchanged issues A + D + U = total number of issues traded each Neither of these adjustments appear to make any substantial difference to the behavior of the basic A-D Line, however: A simple subtraction of declines from ad- vances has always been the most popular and widely used method of calculation. Interpretation of the Cumulative Daily Advance-Decline Line Trends and divergences of the Cumulative Daily Advance-Decline Line relative to a broad-based market price index have long been the most popular techniques of inter- pretation. (There may be a better way to view this data, however; as we shall see, be- low. For example, if the market price index is rising at a time when the Cumulative Advance-Decline Line is declining, underlying market weakness is suggested, and that is bearish warning; and sometimes an early warning, for stock prices. Con- versely, if the market price index is declining while the Cumulative Advance-Decline Line is underlying market strength is evident, and that is a bullish indication for stock prices. The following table shows a traditional interpretation of the Ad- vance-Decline Line compared to broad-based market index, specifically, the Standard & Poor s 500 Index (S&P). Interpretation of the Cumulative Advance-Decline Line Market Index (S&P 500) Advance-Decline Line Interpretation Rising Falling Bearish Near or at previous top Significantly below corresponding top Bearish Near or at previous top Significantly above corresponding top Bullish Falling Rising Bullish Near or at previous bottom Significantly above previous bottom Bullish Near or at previous bottom Significantly below previous bottom Bearish price 1-day day rising; price Advance-Decline Line, A-D Line 63 Indicator Strategy Example for the Cumulative Daily Advance-Decline Line The Cumulative Daily Advance-Decline Line can be an effective indicator on purely objective basis Based on a 68-year file of daily data for the number of shares advancing and declining each on the New York Stock Exchange and the Dow- Jones Industrial Average since its all-time low of 41.22 on July 8, 1932, we found that the simplest possible trend-following rule would have produced a positive result on a purely mechanical signal basis with no subjectivity, no sophisticated technical analy- sis, and no judgement: Enter Long (Buy) at the current daily price close of the Dow-Jones In- dustrial Average when the Cumulative Daily Advance-Decline Line rises relative to its level the previous Close (Sell) at the current daily price close of the Dow-Jones Indus- trial Average when the Cumulative Daily Advance-Decline Line falls rel- ative to its level the previous day: Enter Short (Sell Short) at the current daily price close of the Dow-Jones Industrial Average when the Cumulative Daily Advance-Decline Line falls relative to its level the previous Close Short (Cover) at the current daily price close of the Dow-Jones In- dustrial Average when the Cumulative Daily Advance-Decline Line rises relative to its level the previous Starting with $100 and reinvesting profits, total net profits for this Cumulative Advance-Decline Line trend-following strategy would have been S822.4 million, as- suming fully invested strategy, reinvestment of profits, no transactions costs, and no taxes_ This would have been 3.08 million percent better than buy-and-hold.

Moreover; significant divergences between the Advance-Decline Line and a market index are sometimes clear only in retrospect: The Cumulative Daily Advance-Decline Line has called every major mar- ket decline in history The problem is that it has done nothing but call for major de- clines A cursory glance at the accompanying graph illustrates the problem: At each of the nine junctures labeled on the the Advance-Decline Line showed obvious negative divergences (in hindsight at least) The table, Nine Major A-D Divergences, shows the less-than-impressive results of these bearish warnings.

Subtract the number of declining issues each day from the number of ad- vancing issues 2 Divide that difference (from 1) by the total number of issues traded each day: 3. Finally, tame minor; erratic daily movement by smoothing the ratio (calcu- lated in 2) with a moving average. Calculations in Steps 1 and 2 are written: H = (A DY(A + D + U) where H = today's 1-day ratio of net advances to total issues traded A number of advancing issues D = number of declining issues U = number of unchanged issues A + D + U = total number of issues traded each Raw data is gathered from daily newspapers O electronic data services and is most commonly based on New York Stock Exchange daily trading statistics. Similar indicators may be calculated for other markets, such as the NASDAQ: For another perspective, weekly data, published in weekend news sources, also can be used for a separate calculation. Weekly data produces a much different indicator than the more daily oscillator: The traditional method of chart interpretation examines the oscillator'$ trend, absolute level and level relative to a market index: However; much depends on the experience, judgement, and objectivity of the technical analyst: A risk for the novice is that human judgement can be influenced by subjectivity, including position bias, which inclines the observer to interpret an indicator as bullish if he is and bearish if he is short. Moreover; significant divergences between the oscillator and a market index are sometimes clear only in retrospect; but there is another Indicator Strategy Example of the Hughes Breadth-Momentum Oscillator; Advance- Decline Non-Cumulative The Hughes Breadth-Momentum Oscillator is a useful indicator even without any data smoothing Or other manipulation: Based on 68-year file of daily data for the Step Step day popular price long way: Advance-Decline Non-Cumulative: Hughes Breadth-Momentum Oscillator 69 number of shares advancing and declining each on the New York Stock Exchange and the Dow-Jones Industrial Average since March &, 1932, we found that one of the simplest possible trend-following rules would have produced a positive result on & purely mechanical signal basis with no subjectivity, no sophisticated technical analy- sis, and no judgement: Enter Long (Buy) at the current daily price close of the Dow-Jones In- dustrial Average when the Hughes Breadth-Momentum Oscillator rises to cross above zero_ Close Long (Sell) at the current daily close of the Dow-Jones Indus - trial Average when the Hughes Breadth-Momentum Oscillator falls to cross below zero Enter Short (Sell Short) at the current daily close of the Dow-Jones Industrial Average when the Hughes Breadth-Momentum Oscillator falls to cross below zero.

Starting with $100 and reinvesting profits, total net profits for this Advance/De- cline Ratio trend-following strategy would have been $884,717,056, assuming a fully invested strategy, reinvestment of profits, no transactions costs and no taxes This would have been 7,055,813.92 percent better than buy-and-hold.

The original Advisory Sentiment Index is an overboughtloversold sentiment in- dicator based on the so-called Theory of Contrary Opinion: whatever the majority thinks is supposed to be wrong. Since 1962, Abraham W. Cohen and his successors the editors of the stock market newsletter; Investors Intelligence (1 West Avenue Larchmont; NY 10538), have read about 100 different stock market newsletters and have tallied the percentages expressing clear bullish; bearish; and correction opinions as to the stock market' s future trend: Over the 35 years, the average percentage of bulls has been 42.96%, bears 33.609, and corrections 23.449. By general consensus, the most important number is the percentage of bears. Most people talk bullish most of the time, while the precise meaning of correction can be nebulous But to state a clear bearish opinion is to say something that stands out clearly: Contrary to popular Contrary Opinion, however; buying when the percentage of bears has been above average, and selling and selling short when the percentage of bears has been below average would not have been a profitable strategy. In fact, crossovers of all exponential moving average lengths from 1 to 1000 weeks would have lost money. Even though there was a majority of correct signals for each expo- nential moving average length, losses were than Actually fading the con- trary crowd, that is, going contrary to the contrarians, would have been a profitable strategy: Die-hard contrarians will protest that this indicator should be counted only when it reaches extremes. But the problem with that is that it is difficult to quantify what is meant by extremes because the ranges of the observed data have narrowed since 1974, and especially since 1994 such that the indicator has been growing less and less volatile. This is evident simply by inspecting the chart of the reported data. Because the observed ranges have been changing, interpretation of this indicator generally has become dangerously subjective. Contrary opinion is a popular idea, known even to television commentators whose general level of understanding of technical analysis is superficial, at best. Many experienced technical analysts use sentiment; but more as supplement to trend, momentum, and other technical indicators than as a stand-alone, signal gener- ator: Sentiment typically shows overbought and oversold levels well before the di- rectional price move is over and, therefore, can be misleading when viewed in isolation. In general, sentiment is more of a background indicator that is not suitable for precise timing: past larger gains. 8 Advisory Sentiment Bears times 100, 6500 with Bears 54-week EMA plus 1000 6000 5500 5000 4500 4000; 3500 3000 2500 2000_ 1500 1000 500 10000 5000 Dow-Jones Industrial Average Weekly Price Close Semi-Log Scale Cumulative Equity Line for Longs and Shorts, Semi-Log Scale Advisory Sentiment Bears, with a bullishly skewed decision rule O 786772 62 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72   73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 '84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 199 '0O Advisory Sentiment Bears, Crossing 54-week EMA + 10% Points Total net profit 2649.57 Open position value 765.46 Net Profit/Buy&Hold % 70.27 Percent gain/loss 2649.57 Annual percent gain/loss 69.67 Annual Net %/B&H % 70.26 Initial investment 100 Interest earned Current position Long Date position entered 10/2/98 Buy/Hold profit 1556.12 Days in test 13882 # of per trade 113.79 Buy/Hold pct gain/loss 1556.12 Annual BIH pct gain/loss 40.92 Total closed trades 122 Commissions paid Avg profit per trade 15.44 Avg Win/Avg Loss ratio 6.61 Total long trades 61 Total short trades 61 Win Trade 47.54 Winning long trades 29 Winning short trades 28 Short Win Trade % 45.90 Total winning trades 57 Total losing trades 65 Total Win Trade % 46.72 Amount of winning trades 2276.6 Amount of losing trades 392.49 Net Profit Margin % .59 Average win 39.94 Average loss 6.04 Average P Margin % 73.73 Largest win 1012.36 Largest loss 33.21 % Netf(Win + Loss_ 93.65 Average length of win 25.09 Average length of loss 7.75 (Win Loss)Loss % 223.74 Longest winning trade 194 Longest losing trade 47 (Win Loss)/Loss % 312.77 Most consecutive wins Most consecutive losses (Win Loss)Loss % 33.33 Total bars out 55 Average length out 55 Longest out period 55 System close drawdown Profit/Loss index 87.1 % Net Profit/SODD 420566.67 System open drawdown 0.63 Reward/Risk index 99.98 (Net P SODD)Net P 99.98 Max open trade drawdown 36.53 Buy/Hold index 119.46 % SODDINet Profit 0.02 In the Equis MetaStocke "System Report" (profit and loss summary statistics) , the Total net profit is the sum of profits minus the sum of losses, including open positions 0 marked to the market: In contrast; the Amount of Winning Trades is the sum of realized profits (the total of all on closed-out trades only, excluding any open positions) Similarly; the Amount of Losing Trades is the sum of realized losses (the total of all losses on closed-out trades only, excluding any open positions) .

(Log 500 Andrews' Pitchfork: Median Line Method 85 Andrews' Pitchfork: Median Line Method Andrews Pitchfork, or Median Line Method, is chart-based visual tool used to judge trend strength, support, and resistance. It was developed by Alan Hall Andrews for use on arithmetic-scaled bar-charts. Andrews Pitchfork requires three price pivot points separated by time and price: an early high (or low), a subsequent reaction low (or high) , and a still later high (or low) Andrews' Pitchfork may be drawn after any price reaction; that is, after any correction against an existing trend. From the midpoint between the reaction high and (the second and third dates in time) , extend a line backward in time (into the past) to the original price extreme (either a high or a low) that marked the beginning of the trend at hand. Next, using that midpoint line, draw two parallel lines, one from the re- cent reaction high, and one from the recent reaction low Extend all three parallel lines forward into the future Highs and lows may be defined as pivot points. On a daily bar chart, pivot high is a daily high immediately preceded by lower daily high and fol- lowed by a lower daily high. A pivot low is a low immediately preceded by a higher low and followed by higher low. three pivot can be used to draw Andrews' Pitchfork: To keep it sim- ple, select obvious points that mark substantial and consecutive directional changes of similar magnitude. If you become confused by too many pivot points, switch to a bar chart of the next larger time frame, and move from the daily to the weekly bar chart. Although traditionally technical analysts use their judgement to select appropri- ate price pivot points, various quantitative filters rules can be devised to define ap- propriate pivot points. example, Envelopes, Bollinger Bands, and Price Channels can be used. A significant pivot point is identified when price tags an extreme boundary line and then reverses below the low of the previous bar or bars. Also, momentum divergences could be used for identifying pivot points. Three specific criteria for constructing Andrews' Pitchfork were developed by Barbara Star in her 1995 article, Support and Resistance with the Andrews Pitch- fork; Technical Analysis of Stocks Commodities; Vol. 13, www.traders.com_ First; identify a new trend after a successful retest of a low or high. Second, identify a subsequent reaction (a corrective move against the trend) that breaks the conventional trendline. Third, quickly identify when the trend resumes At that point; there is a trend and a countertrend reaction from which to draw the median line and two parallel low price point point Any points price For price price lines. 86 Technical Market Indicators Another way to view this method is sequentially in time. When viewing an up- trend, first select the low that marks the end of the previous downtrend and the beginning of the current uptrend. Second, select a subsequent price high: Third, select still later reaction low. When viewing a downtrend, select the high that marks the end of the previous uptrend and the beginning of the current downtrend, select a sub- sequent low, and select a still later reaction high. In either an uptrend or downtrend, the median line connects the earliest of three outstanding price pivot points to a midway between the two more recent price pivot points one a high and the other a low. This median line becomes the handle of the pitchfork: The second and third lines are drawn parallel to the handle of the pitchfork from the two more recent pivot points, the high and the low: These two parallel lines, extending forward in time, are the tines of the pitchfork: All three parallel lines, the handle and the two tines, may offer support and re- sistance before the fact, making them useful in trading: Often, will approach, meet or even slightly exceed a line, but fail to close beyond it: Such failures at sup- port and resistance offer low-risk trading opportunities: close stop-loss orders may be placed just beyond the extreme price of the failure bar: A recent example is shown on the chart. First, the DJIA made a new all-time high at 11909 on 1/14/00, and that obvious high was selected as one. Second, the DJIA fell to an obvious low of 9612 on 3/8/00, and that obvious low was selected as point two_ Third, the DJIA rose to an obvious high of 11600 on 4/12/00, that obvious high was selected as three. Note the next decline found support near the pitchfork handle, and the next two rally attempts found resistance near the upper pitchfork tine. Once resistance at the upper tine was penetrated on a closing ba- sis, it switched roles and became support: The S&P 500 futures made an obvious low in October 1998,and that was selected as an obvious one. The all-time high in July 1999 was an obvious two The low in October 1999 stood out as an obvious three. Note how the sub- sequent rallies found resistance near the pitchfork handle Also, the lower pitchfork tine offered both support and resistance. Past April 2000,it became increasingly evi- dent that the bull trend was unable to recover its upward momentum, having failed to overcome that lower pitchfork tine by increasingly larger amounts on rally attempt. point price price point and how point price point point point each 11900 Andrews' Pitchfork on the 11850 Dow-Jones Industrial Average 11800 11750 Daily Price Bars 11700 Arithmetic Scale 11650 11600 Vanuary to July, 2000 11550 11500 11450 11400 11350 11300 11250 11200 11150 11100 11050 11000 10950 10900 10850 10800 10750 10700 10550 10500 10550 10500 10450 10400 10350 10300 10250 10200 10150 10100 10050 10000 9950 9900 9850 9800 9750 9700 9650 9600 2 9550 T1o ji8 p4 3h1 14 122 p8l h3 b2o 127 h1o W1z 14 h5 022 112 [T9 26 12000 FFebruary MMarch April May [une 9 8 1550 15008 1450} 1400 1350 1300 1250 1200 1150 Andrews' Pitchfork On the s&p 500 Futures Contract (CSI Perpetual) Daily Price Bars: 1100 Arithmetic Scale 1050 1000 950 Vemm eeennnmeneenmn MM_ihMe:  MMT UM TmneO IMT;TMI17 Mu:ftTIc TUTTne" fc4niamimnn AACuMaIMMM MTTAUGMTA  FUOaTL_IMT CUMMMTM; pmumimM6aMetmtnIMgMMMMMMmmM.MtMMT mtmtmtmmmtmttmm Oct INov Dec 11999 Feb MMar JApr_ May 'Jun Uul @ct WNov Dec 2000 FFeb Mar Apr MMay Jun Jul ISer Aug ISep Aug Arms' Ease of Movement Value (EMV) 89 Arms' Ease of Movement Value (EMV) Arms Ease of Movement Value (EMV) quantifies the ease with which prices are moving: EMV is a moderately effective price and volume momentum indicator de- veloped by Richard W. Arms, Jr: (Arms Advisory, 800 Wagontrain Drive $. E. Albu- querque, NM 87102). The larger the price change and the lighter the volume, the easier the movement EMV is simply change (using midpoints of the range) divided by the ratio of volume divided by range. Mathematically, EMV may be expressed as follows: EVM = (((H + L)/2) - ((Hp + Lp)/2)))(VI(H L)) where H the current period' high price. L the current period'< low Hp the previous period's high the previous period's low price. the current period's volume. The raw EMV may be smoothed by a moving average, and that average may produce a buy signal when it crosses above zero, and a sell signal when it crosses be- the zero. High readings on smoothed EMV imply easy upward price movement; so the path of least resistance is bullish: Low readings on smoothed EMV imply easy downward movement; so the of least resistance is bearish: Indicator Strategy Example for the Arms' Ease of Movement Value (EMV) Historical data shows that the EMV can be a moderately effective indicator on both the and short sides, but particularly on the long side. Based on the daily for the Dow-Jones Industrial Average for 72 years from 1928 to 2000, found that the following parameters would have produced a positive result on a purely mechan- ical trend-following signal basis with no subjectivity, no sophisticated technical analysis, and no judgement: Enter Long (Buy) at the current daily price close of the Dow-Jones In- dustrial Average when EMV smoothed by a 4-period exponential moving average rises above zero_ Close (Sell) at the current daily price close of the Dow-Jones Indus- trial Average when EMV smoothed by a 4-period exponential moving av- erage falls below zero. price price. price.

Arms, Jr: (Arms Advisory, 800 Wagontrain Drive $. E: Albuquerque; NM 87102). Arms' Index is also commonly referred to by its quote machine symbols, TRIN and MKDS. Mathematically, Arms Index is calculated as follows: (Advances/Declines)(Advancing Volume/Declining Volume) Thus, Arms Index is calculated using four numbers combined into three ratios. These three ratios use four numbers derived from closing and volume data for all issues traded each on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) This data is readily available from online sources such as Reuters. Also, the data is published in many daily newspapers For example, in the Wall Street Journal, this data appears on page C2, under STOCK MARKET DATA BANK, DIARIES, NYSE The four required numbers are: price price long: long: price day Arms' Short-Term Trading Index TRIN, MKDS) 93 Advances, or advancing issues, are the number of NYSE listed stocks with positive, upward price change for the day; Declines, Or declining issues, are the number of NYSE listed stocks with a negative, downward price change for the day; ZAdv vol (000) , the volume of advancing issues, or Advancing Volume; and zDec vol (000), the volume of declining issues, or Declining Volume. After gathering this data, the Arms' Index is computed in three steps: 1. Divide the number of advancing issues by the number of declining issues; that is, Advances/Declines; 2_ Divide the volume of advancing issues by the volume of declining issues; that is, ZAdv vollzDec vol; 3. Divide the ratio obtained in by the ratio obtained in 2; that is, (Advances/DeclinesJ(ZAdv vollzDec vol). Arms Index effectively quantifies the intensity of buying pressure relative to the intensity of selling pressure for the market as whole. We found that both ex- tremely high Arms' Index levels greater than 1.444 and extremely low Arms' Index levels of 0.523 or less were bullish and statistically significant at the 99% confidence level over a I-year holding period (or forward window of time). This means that there was less than an one in 100 probability that the stock market rose by chance alone af- ter extreme readings in the daily Arm'$ Index. Although at first impression it may seem odd that both extremely high and ex tremely low levels would be bullish; we can understand this as we reflect on how markets bottom and reverse trend. Important trend reversals are characterized by extreme in market sentiment: First; sentiment is extremely bearish as the market falls (to extremely oversold) at the end of a substantial market When selling is exhausted, meaning everyone who can sell has already sold, selling pressure dries Up, and bargain hunters move in: Prices start to move up causing short sellers to cut losses, and portfolio managers must quickly jump on board the rise so will not fall behind their performance benchmarks. A powerful rebound effect emerges from the ruins left by the bear: There is a price reversion to the mean (for example, to 50-day or 200-day moving average) , Or perhaps beyond. The sudden imbalance of buying pressure over selling pressure produces distorted ratios of relative to selling at the beginning of a new bull wave Thus, extremely high and extremely low levels of the Arms' Index are both bullish, first with high levels on the selling climax then followed by low levels on the one-sided, snap-back rally: Intense selling pressure was bullish. If there was significantly more selling pres- sure than buying pressure on any given day; the Arms' Index rose to 1.444 or higher; and it was probable at the 99% confidence level that the market would be higher in a Step Step swings price drop. they buy- ing panic year: 94 Technical Market Indicators Intense buying pressure was bullish: If there was significantly more buying pressure than selling pressure on any given the Arms Index fell to 0.523 or lower; and it was probable at the 999 confidence level that the market would be higher in 6-month and 1-year holding periods. For shorter-term forward time win- dows of 1 month and 3 months, readings of 0.523 or lower also were bullish, but at the lesser 95% confidence level. Arms Index levels above 0.523, but below 1.444, had no statistical significance. Technical analysts traditionally have smoothed raw data with their standard 10- period simple moving average of the daily readings They have done this in order to even out erratic day-to-day movements The results of 10-day simple moving aver- ages greater than 1.266 were very bullish over 1-year holding periods (forward time windows). These results were statistically highly significant at the 99.9% confidence level, which means that there was less than an one in 1000 probability that the stock market rose by chance alone after high 10-day Arms Index reading in excess of 1.266. The following table, Out-of-Sample Simulation for Arms' 10-day SMA 1.266, shows out-of-sample testing without hindsight bias. It shows all of the com- pleted round-turn trades signaled by Arms' Index 10-day simple moving average greater than 1.266. (The 1988 edition of this book established these specific parame- ters . Because these parameters were established on available data before 1987, the performance statistics in the table represent a simulation of what realistically might have been achieved using this indicator; excluding transactions costs, taxes and divi- dends An initial $1O0.00 would have grown to $454.95 without a losing trade. Note that in our testing, repeated signal (that is, Arm's 10-day SMA > 1.266) within one year of the previous signal extended the 1-year holding to one year from the repeated buy signal. Thus, a series of repeated signals ex- tended the holding period substantially For example, the long-side trade that was opened on 10/16/87 remained open more than 5 years until 12/3/92 because of re- peated signals before the previous signal was yet one year old. Note also that the actual reading of Arms Index on 7/16/86 was 1.2663, which rounds down to 1.266, but is actually greater than 1.266, as our strict decision rule demands.

For each reading in a range, the or loss in subsequent time periods (1 month later; 3 months later; 6 months later; and 12 months later) was calculated. The combined results for readings within each range were statistically compared, chi-squared tests, to the performance of the over- all market (as measured by the Standard & Poor's 500). Varying degrees of bullish and bearish significance were noted on the basis of that comparison. Countless variations for manipulating this fascinating indicator are too numerous to test here. The 10 TRIN" or 10 Trading Index" is calculated by dividing ratio of a 10-day total of the number of advancing issues to a 10-day total of the num- ber of declining issues by a ratio ofa 10-day total of volume of advancing issues to a 10- total of the volume of declining issues. The "Open 30 TRIN" or "Open 30 Trading Index" are Similar; and use 30-day totals. Analysts have experimented with Fi- bonacci numbers, other number progressions and optimization for the totals, and they have varied the signal threshold levels in a wide variety of increments, not neces- sarily symmetrically, since observed raw data are not distributed symmetrically around the balanced ratio of 1.00. single day's Arms' Index reading at 2.65 and higher was found to be a use- ful threshold in 1986. (See Alphier; J,, & Kuhn; B. SA helping hand from the Arms Index; Technical   Analysis   of  Stocks & Commodities; Vol. 5.4, pp. 142-143, WWW.traders.com If we bought the S&P 500 Composite Stock Price Index on the close of every day when the Arms' Index was 2.65 or higher and held for one year; would have made a 11 out of 12 times over the past 35 years: 929 of the signals were profitable. Because these parameters were established on available data before 1987, the performance statistics in the table on trades closed out after 1987 represent a simulation of what realistically might have been achieved this indicator; excluding transac- tions costs, taxes and dividends. An initial S1O0.00 in 1986 would have grown to S273.25 without a trade. Like our Arms Index 10-day simple moving average greater than 1.266 rule, 1OO% accuracy in a 14-year; out-of-sample simulation with dif- ferent parameters suggests that the underlying idea behind the Arms' Index may well be worthwhile. Note that in our testing repeated signal (that is, an Arm' s Index reading greater than 2.65), within one year of the previous signal, extended the 1- year period to one year from the repeated buy signal. Thus, a series of peated signals extended the holding period substantially: For example, the long-side trade opened on 7/7/86 and remained open more than 5 years until 10/10/91 because of repeated signals before the previous signal was yet one year old. gain four using ~Open ~Open day - they day we profit using losing buy 1-day buy holding re- buy buy buy 96 Technical Market Indicators Updated Arms' Index 2.65, Out-of-Sample Since 10/14/86 Arms' Date S&P 500 1 Yr S&P 500 Net Profit Net P % Compound Since '86 2.82 6/24/65 83.56 6/24/66 86.58 3.02 3.61 103.61 2.99 10/3/66 74.90 10/3/67 96.65 21.75 29.04 133.70 3.16 3/14/68 88.32 3/14/69 98.00 9.68 10.96 148.35 3.50 5/4/70 79.37 5/4/71 103.79 24.42 30.77 193.99 2.81 9/27/74 64.94 *12/2/75 89.33 24.39 37.56 266.85 2.66 10/14/76 100.88 *11/18/77 95.33 -5.55 5.50 252.17 3.06 5/7/79 99.02 *10/25/83 166.45 67.43 68.10 423.90 2.78 2/8/84 155.85 *1/2/86 209.59 53.74 34.48 570.06 2.81 7/7/86 244.05 *10/10/91 380.55 136.50 55.93 888.90 155.93 4.02 11/15/91 382.60 11/16/92 420.70 38.10 9.96 977.42 171.46 2.85 2/16/93 433.91 2/16/94 472.79 38.88 8.96 1065.00 186.82 8.82 10/27/97 876.98 *9/30/99 1282.71 405.73 46.26 1557.72 273.25 4.01 4/14/00 1356.56 4/14/01 *1-year holding period extended by repeat signals: Arms' Index 2.65_ Shorter-term trading with the Arms' Index is an irresistible temptation. After all, the full name of the indicator is "the Arms' Short-Term Trading Index.' In the real- world, few traders would have the patience to hold for & year based on a historical study of the data. We searched for a mechanical long and short decision rule that would be tive to the current action of the market. Based on a 16-year file of daily data for the Arms Short-Term Trading Index, and for an adjusted series of price data for the S&P 500 Depositary Receipts from inception in 1993 and the S&P futures from 1984 to 1993, we found that the following parameters would have produced a positive result on a purely mechanical signal basis with no subjectivity, no sophisticated technical analysis, and no judgement: Enter (Buy) at the current daily price close when the I1-day expo- nential moving average of the daily Arms Short-Term Trading Index is greater than 0.800.

Chande in his 1995 article, A Time Price Oscilla- tor; Technical Analysis of   Stocks Commodities   (Vol.   13, pp. 369-374), WWW.traders.com_ The idea was to quickly detect the change from directional trend to flat range (and vice versa) by measuring the number of time periods within a defined moving time window of n-periods that have passed since the most recent n-period high and n-period low. Aroon Oscillator is the difference between Aroon Up minus Aroon Down. Mathematically, Aroon may be expressed as follows: Aroon Up 100 (n H)n) Aroon Down 100 * ((n L)n) where Aroon Up the number of periods since the most recent high; expressed as a percentage of the total number of periods, n Aroon Down the number of periods since the most recent low, expressed as a percentage of the total number of periods, n. H = the number of periods within a defined moving time window of n-periods since the most recent high: L = the number of periods within a defined moving time window of n-periods since the most recent low: n = the total number of 'periods in the moving time window being evaluated. Aroon has two parts, each of which range from 0 to 100. Aroon Up measures the number of periods since the most recent n-period high: When makes a new n- period high, Aroon Up 100, and that indicates a trend. When has not made a new high for n-periods, Aroon Up equals 0, indicating that the uptrend has lost bullish momentum_ Aroon Down measures the number of periods since the most recent low. When makes a new Aroon Down equals 100, indicating a weak trend. When has not made a new low for n-periods, Aroon Down equals 0, and that indicates that the downtrend has lost bearish momentum. A strong uptrend is indicated when the Aroon Up line persistently remains be- tween 70 and 100 while the Aroon Down line persistently remains between 0 and 30. A significant downtrend is indicated when the Aroon Down line persistently remains between 70 and 100 while the Aroon Up line persistently remains between 0 and 30. price trading n-period n-period n-period n-period price equals price price strong n-period price n-period low, price price Aroon, Aroon Oscillator 103 clear and simple decision rule is: when the Aroon Up line crosses above the Aroon Down line; sell when the Aroon Down line crosses above the Aroon Up line. This is the same as the Aroon Oscillator crossing zero. Indicator Strategy Example for Aroon Up Crossing Aroon Down Historical data shows that Aroon can be a moderately effective indicator 0n side only: It lost money on the short side. Based on the daily prices for the Dow-Jones In- dustrial Average for 72 years from 1928 to 2000, we found that the following para- meters would have produced a positive result on a purely mechanical trend-following signal   basis   with no subjectivity, no sophisticated technical analysis,  and no judgement: Enter Long (Buy) at the current daily price close of the Dow-Jones In- dustrial Average when the 2-day Aroon Up is greater than the 2-day Aroon Down. Close Long (Sell) at the current daily close of the Dow-Jones Indus- trial Average when the 2-day Aroon Up is less than the 2-day Aroon Down. Enter Short (Sell Short) never: Starting with $100 and reinvesting profits, total net profits for this Aroon only strategy would have been S7,132.30, assuming a fully invested strategy, rein- vestment of profits, no transactions costs, and no taxes. This would have been 55.89 percent better than buy-and-hold. Short selling; which was not included in this strat- egy; would have lost money over the entire 72-years as a whole; but those short-side losses would not have exceeded long-side profits.

It is well known that W. D. Gann, a highly influ- ential technician and trader who practiced in the first half of the 20h century, intensely applied astrology to market timing, reportedly with remarkable success. Unfortu- nately, Gann's methods are not fully disclosed in his writings. Astrological literature accumulated over the 4000 could fill whole li- braries. It was an important academic discipline taught in major universities until just Long long: long: past years Astrology; Financial Applications of Astronomical Cycles 109 few hundred years ago. Today, astrology has fallen out of fashion on campus, but re- tains a wide following off campus. Few market technicians acknowledge any attempt to incorporate astrology into their work: Some unknowable number of large money managers take an active but se- cret interest in the subject: Arch Crawford and Bill Meridian are the most prominent technical analysts who openly use astrology in their work Arch Crawford has been named *Wall Street's best known astrologer" by Bar- ron' s financial weekly, based on his many uncanny predictions over the past 40 He is famous for calling the Crash of 87 months in advance, and he correctly pre- dicted bear markets in July 1990 and March 2000. Crawford also has pinpointed in advance many minor trend change dates, such as the temporary bottom on April 4, 2001. And his forecasts extend beyond market turns_ In his newsletter dated Septem- ber 4, 2001, just seven days before the World Trade Center was hit in New York on 9/11, Crawford specifically identified two separate Mars aspects that could lead to war and a steep drop in stock prices in days ahead. Crawford offers a investment advisory service focusing on market tim- ing for the U.S. general stock market price indexes (primarily the S&P 500, the Dow- Jones Industrial Average, and the NASDAQ 100) as well as futures, including U.S. Treasuries, Gold, Oil, and Foreign Currencies. more than two decades he has published monthly newsletter;  Crawford Perspectives, 6890 E.

Crawford s combination of astronomical cycles and technical analysis to make mar- ket calls have earned him top ratings in market timing in the Hulbert and Timer Di- gest surveys_ Bill Meridian is an internationally renowned financial researcher; fund manager; and designer of analytical software, including the first program developed for re- searching the correlation between time series data (including stock prices) and plan- etary Also, he compiled an authoritative collection of first trade charts for 1062 individual stocks in the 1998 edition of his book, Planetary Stock Trading: Meridian found that the astrological chart of the date of the initial trade in a stock cor- relates with subsequent changes in the stock'$ price trend His 55 case studies of widely held stocks show precisely how progressions and transits correlate with changes in price. Meridian 's latest book, Planetary Economic Forecasting, correlates monthly index of industrial production with planetary cycles over 200 years His 1994 study of the effect of the lunar on the DJIA was confirmed by an analysis at the University of Michigan in 2001.

The Mars Vesta Cycle in U.S. Stock Prices, by Bill Meridian One of the dominant rhythms in common stock is a of approximately four years in length. Examples of lows in this are 1974,1978,1982, 1986, 1990, 1994,and 1998. When this first came under scrutiny, analysts attributed the phenomenon to the four in the presidential They theorized that the government stimu- lated the economy through the Federal Reserve at election time to provide the illusion of prosperity and ensure the reelection of the incumbent: However; closer analysis re- veals that the also exists in countries where elections are held every Six or eight years. And yet; local media people continue to describe bull and bear markets in terms of their own economies and local events. They do not see that there is some force at work, known as the principle of commonality: In addition, the existed well before the establishment of the Fed in 1913. The powerful Rothschild banking family is said to have been the first to exploit the 4-year cycle for profitable trading in the 1800's. On June 30, 1952, Veryl L. Dun- bar described a 3.84-year in Barron' s_ There is a planetary correlation to this cycle. In order to determine the length of synodic planetary period in longitude (the length of time that elapses from the con- junction of two bodies to their next conjunction) , substitute the sidereal periods in the following formula: (A X BI(A B) = Synodic Cycle where A and B are the sidereal periods of the two planets involved) Substitution of the sidereal periods of the planet Mars and the asteroid Vesta which is usually prominent in the natal horoscopes of professional stock traders) into this formula gives a cycle of 3.90 years_ The stock market tops out at the 90-degree aspect of Mars-Vesta, and it bottoms out at the 240-degree angle of Mars-Vesta: The table on the next page shows the re- sults since 1903 of a mechanical buy-and-sell strategy based on Mars-Vesta Cycle timing versus the passive buy-and-hold strategy The portfolio bought the Dow Jones Industrial Average whenever Mars and Vesta were 240 degrees apart and then sold the DJIA when Mars and Vesta were 90 degrees apart: In cases where the aspect occurred more than once due to retrograde motion; the latest aspect was selected as the or sell signal. prices cycle cycle cycle cycle: years cycle larger cycle cycle buy Astrology; Financial Applications of Astronomical Cycles 111 Following the signals of this Mars-Vesta cycle market timing rule, S1,000 portfolio would have grown to $283,472, versus $117,645 for the buy-and-hold strat- egy: This outperformance is better then 2.4 to 1. Moreover; the performance of the cy- cle has been improving since our publication, since the cycle outperformed by only 1.9 to 1 up to 1985. The Mars-Vesta market timing rule generated 19 and six losses, for 769 correct signals. Again, performance has been improving: four of the six losses were before 1942, there have been only two moderately incorrect signals since 1942, and all the signals since 1982 have been profitable. For simplicity of pre- sentation, these figures ignore trading costs, interest rates, dividends, and leverage.

Mills (1867) speculated that the "mental mood of businessmen tends to run in cy- cles_ Throughout economic history, generations of human beings appear to repeat cycles of manic optimism and depressed pessimism. Crises occur when there is a sud- den shift in sentiment from greed to fear: The 56-year correlates closely with cycles of the sun and the moon It is well established that these cycles have a direct impact on planet earth and its all its life forms, including human beings The sun moon directly impact the following earthly phenomena: gravitational causes tides in the sea, atmosphere, and land surface; earthquake and volcanic activity; weather; magnetic and electromagnetic energy fields; the four seasons; the 24-hour sex- ual/breeding cycles (human average menstrual cycle is the same as the synodic month of 29.5 days and the average human gestation is 9 synodic months); reproduc- tion, molting, and many physiological rhythms in mammals are regulated by seasonal changes in the photo (variation in hours of daylight); and gravity effects bio- logical tides of bodily liquids in life forms, and that may impinge on physical func- tions and emotions. The S6-year cycle appears to correlate with angular relationships between the sun and moon: the angles 05 and 1805 between the sun, moon, and nodes repeat to within one degree every 56 and 9 solar years. Perfect correlations exist be- tween the 36 year sub-cycles and: 1) zodiacal placement of the conjunctions of the sun and moon'$ north node; 2) the moon angles to these sun and moon'$ north node conjunctions; 3) the position of the moon'$ north node on a specific date of the year: Major financial crises are most likely to occur when the moon'$ north node is in the quadrants: Aries-Taurus-Gemini and Libra-Scorpio-Sagittarius. Several   variables combine to give rise to complex cyclical behavior: Specific patterns never repeat ex- actly but vary and change progressively over time spans McMinn'$ ideas pre- sented here were adapted from the Technical Securities Analysts Association of San Francisco monthly newsletter; April, 1996. Evidence   of Precise Long-Wave   Stock Cycles, was presented by Christopher L_ Carolan, of Calendar Research; Inc. PO Box 680666, Marietta, GA 30068, (770) 579-5804, www_calendarresearch com. From his position on the floor of the exchange, Carolan witnessed first hand the effects of the 1987 crash; which occurred on precisely the same date on the lunar calendar as the 1929 crash; according to Carolan'$ Spiral Calendar: This tool identifies potential turning in the stock market that provide highly significant correlations by chi-squared tests. Ba- sically, solar and lunar eclipses offer significant market timing dates, although not all eclipses have an impact on the market: Tops and panics are associated with eclipses that occur with a cycle of approximately 36- and 58-years since 1763.

This is brief summary of Carolan's talk given at the Market Technicians Association's 2Sth Annual Seminar in 2000, adapted from the notes of Mike Carr; which were posted on the MTA web site, WWWmta org: It is interesting to note how the same or similar cycle lengths appear in the work of independent researchers differing approaches (See Cycles: . Average Directional Movement (ADX) See Directional Movement: Average True Range The Average True Range is simply the average of the True Ranges over the past n-pe- riods. True Range is the full price range of a period, including gaps are price points where there were no actual trades executed. often occur overnight; and often in reaction to news events, although gaps can occur within any time interval and without any event: J. Welles Wilder; Jr,, in his 1978 book New Concepts in Technical Trading Sys- tems (Trend Research, PO Box 128,McLeansville, NC 27301) defined True Range as the largest value of the following three possibilities: T = H-L T =H =P T =P -L where T = True Range. H = the highest price of the current period. L = the lowest of the current period. P = the closing price of the previous period. Wilder defined Average True Range (ATR) as a exponential smoothing (O1 ex- ponential moving average) of True Range. Most frequently, Wilder uses examples with an exponential smoothing constant of 1/14,or 0.07143, which is roughly alent to 27-day simple moving average. For his Volatility Index, Wilder uses an ex - ponential smoothing constant of 1/7 , or 0.14286, which is roughly equivalent to a 13-day simple moving average. day: May using Gaps Gaps price equiv- 114 Technical Market Indicators Black-Box Systems These are proprietary indicators offered without documentation: The algorithm o for- mula needed to calculate the result is not divulged. The quite understandable business reason for such non-disclosure is to preserve the uniqueness of the analysis, to pre- vent widespread imitation, and to maintain trade secrets. Unfortunately for the user; however; such secrecy also prevents him from understanding and developing confi- dence in the indicator output: If a trader cannot understand exactly what an indicator is saying and why, then he is likely to abandon all discipline based on such an indica- tor after a few losing signals. Although strings of losing signals are common to most indicators, good indicators overcome this problem if the trader sticks with the disci- pline of following every signal. But such persistence is less likely with a black box: Also, if the underlying assumptions on which the indicator relies should be changed by any powerful external development; the user would not be equipped to compre- hend a problem before substantial losses are incurred. Furthermore, relying on pro- prietary indicator does not contribute to intellectual development, enhanced trading skills or growth of wisdom of its user: Therefore, most thoughtful technicians avoid all proprietary indicators. There are, after all, many interesting and useful concepts to explore that are fully available for thorough analysis. And, no matter if an indicator is accepted Or rejected, a thorough analysis of the workings and the past performance of an indicator offers beneficial insights into the nature of market movements Bollinger Bands This popular indicator is similar to the older moving average envelope. It was devel- by John A. Bollinger; CFA, CMT; Bollinger Capital Management, Inc. PO Box 3358, Manhattan Beach, CA 90266, (310) 798-8855, wwwbollingerbands_com: In contrast to the moving average envelope, instead of plotting a "resistance" line some fixed percentage above moving average and another support" line the same fixed percentage below a moving average, Bollinger plots resistance line two standard deviations above and support line two standard deviations below 20-day simple moving average_ Bollinger Bands are versatile and can be adapted to any time frame, from min- utes to months_ are designed to quickly react to large moves in the market, and to show whether prices are high or low relative to normal trading ranges Bollinger uses his bands with other indicators to confirm action. Bollinger suggests the 20-day simple moving average with plus and minus two standard deviations to be descriptive of the intermediate-term trend. These have be- come the most default settings For analysis of the short-term trend, Bollinger suggests a 10-day simple moving average with one and a half standard deviations. oped They price popular . For Bollinger Bands 115 analysis of the long-term trend, Bollinger suggests a 50-day simple moving average with two and a half standard deviations. Bollinger notes that the moving average length should be descriptive of the cho- sen time frame, and that this moving average is almost always a different length than the one that proves most useful for crossover buys and sells. Also, Bollinger suggests that a way to identify an appropriate moving average length is to choose one that prO- vides support to the correction of the first move up off a bottom. If the average is pen- etrated by the correction, then the average is too short; and if the correction falls short of the average, then the average is too long: The moving average ought to provide support far more often than it is broken. Bollinger does not recommend applying his Bands for absolute and sell sig- nals when touches Or crosses the Bands. Rather; he uses Bands to provide framework within which may be related to other; independent technical indica- tors, such as on-balance volume or money flow. For example, if price touches the up- per band and the chosen independent technical indicator confirms such price strength, no sell signal is generated_-instead a continuation buy confirmation is recognized. On the other hand, if price tags the upper band and the independent indicator does not confirm such price strength (that is, the indicator diverges negatively), a sell signal is recognized. Another example of a sell signal is after a series of higher price highs, all pushing to or outside the upper band, a final new high is unable to meet the up- per band, thus indicating a loss of upward price momentum and offering a sell signal. A mirTor-image analysis would apply to the use of the lower bands for recog- nizing signals For example, if price touches the lower band and the chosen in- dependent  technical  indicator  confirms such weakness, no signal is generated, but instead, a continuation sell confirmation is recognized. On the other hand, if tags the lower band and the independent indicator does not confirm such weakness (that is, the indicator diverges positively) , a signal is nized. Another example of a signal is after a series of lower price lows, all push- to or below the lower band, final new low is unable to meet the lower band, thus indicating a loss of downward momentum and offering signal. Indicator Strategy Example for Bollinger Bands Bollinger Bands require experience and judgement to use as Bollinger intended. But even naive testing assumptions suggest that Bollinger Bands may have some objec- tive potential value as a purely mechanical, contra-trend technical indicator The great majority of oversold signals would have been profitable. Moreover; these signals would have been robust, with all simple moving average lengths from 6 to 50 minus and plus two standard-deviations, profitable and right most of the time, for long trades only: buy price price price buy price buy price price buy recog- buy ing price price buy buy buy days; again 116 Technical Market Indicators As attractive as a high percentage of profitable trades may seem, it is important to note that this, like other contra-trend strategies, failed to provide any protection in the Crash of 87, the decline of 1998, and other market price drops. As the chart shows, there are sharp equity drawdowns Using Bollinger Bands for contra-trend oversold and overbought signals would have underperformed the passive buy-and- hold strategy: Short selling would not have been profitable in the past.

But; unlike Stochastics, which is bounded by 0 and 100, %b moves beyond these bound- aries when are outside of the bands. %b below 0 is below the lower band: %b at 0 is at the lower band. %b at 50 is mid-way between the upper and lower bands %b at 100 is at the upper band. %b above 100 is above the upper band: The %b indicator can be used for overboughtloversold signals, and %b invites comparison to the price itself and to other indicators for confirmation and divergence analysis. Bollinger Band Width Index The Bollinger Band Width Index is four times the 20-day standard deviation of the daily price closes. According to John A. Bollinger; CFA, CMT; volatility is cyclical, and unusually low volatility periods alternate with periods of unusually high volatil- ity. The Bollinger Band Width Index quantifies this volatility Bollinger uses it to identify periods of unusual and unsustainable volatility, which can lead to the oppO- site condition. For example, Bollinger notes that a drop in band width below 29 for the Standard & Poor  s 500 has led to moves. Also, Bollinger uses Band Width to identify the end of trends The Bollinger Band Width Index is given by the follow- Bollinger Band Width Index (UpperBB LowerBB )/MiddleBB where the UpperBB is the moving average of close plus two standard deviations, the LowerBB is the moving average of close minus two standard deviations, and the MiddleBB is the moving average itself: Assuming the default parameters suggested by John Bollinger of plus or minus two standard deviation bands around 20-day simple moving average, the above for- mula reduces to: Bollinger Band Width Index (4 20-day sigma)/20-day mean where sigma is the 20-day standard deviation of the closing around the 20-day simple moving average. prices large ing: price Bolton-Tremblay Indicator 121 Bolton-Tremblay Indicator The Bolton-Tremblay Indicator is a cumulative advance-decline indicator that uses the number of unchanged issues as a basic component: Because of its greater compu- tational complexity, the Bolton-Tremblay Indicator is not nearly as popular as the simpler breadth calculations. Only the basics of its calculation are presented here_ The Bolton-Tremblay Indicator is computed in five steps 1. Divide the number of advancing issues by the number of unchanged issues 2_ Divide the number of declining issues by the number of unchanged issues. 3. Subtract the declining ratio from the advancing ratio. 4 Calculate the square root of the difference. 5. Add the square root to the previous day's Bolton-Tremblay Indicator; re- specting the sign (plus if there were more advances, minus if more declines). The indicator is expressed by using the following two formulas: If there are greater number of advances than declines, then: T = Y + (Square Root ((A/U) (DIU))) But if there are a lesser number of advances than declines, then: T =Y _ (Square Root (A/U) (DIU) I) where T = today's Bolton-Tremblay Indicator Y = yesterday' s Bolton-Tremblay Indicator A number of advancing issues D number of declining issues U number of unchanged issues X = absolute value of x For example, if yesterday's Bolton-Tremblay Indicator was 1000, and today' s market is strong, with 1400 advancing issues, 600 declining issues, and 200 un- changed issues, today's Bolton-Tremblay Indicator is calculated as follows: T = 1000 + (Square Root ((A/U) _ (D/U))) T = 1000 + (Square Root ((1400/200) (600/200))) T = 1000 + (Square Root ((7) (3))) T = 1000 + (Square Root (4)) T = 1002 122 Technical Market Indicators But if today' $ market is weak, with 600 advancing issues, 1400 declining issues, and 200 unchanged issues, today' $ Bolton-Tremblay Indicator is calculated as follows: T = 1000 (Square Root (600/200) (1400/200) |) T = 1000 (Square Root (3) - (7) |) T = 1000 (Square Root (4)_ T = 1000 (2) T = 998 Begin calculating the Bolton-Tremblay Indicator at any arbitrary start date. Starting with positive value for Y (for example, 1000) is recommended in order to avoid the extra effort of working with cumulative negative numbers. The Bolton-Tremblay Indicator can be charted and interpreted in a manner sim- ilar to the Advance-Decline Line. Traditionally, technical analysts focused on indica- tor divergences from a market price index, such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average, to gauge underlying strength or weakness in the market The absolute and relative levels of the indicator are less important than its trend. Bracketing; Brackets, Dynamic Brackets Bracketing is an extremely flexible and adaptive analytical tool that can be used to identify extremes at absolute or relative levels in otherwise hard-to-tame data. Brack- eting is a primary tool of Ned Davis Research, Inc , 600 Bird Drive West; Venice, FL 34292, phone (941) 484-6107 , fax (941) 484-6221, WWW.ndr.com Some source data is so orderly that it offers obvious and stable extremes in high and low values that possess predictive capacity. It is a simple exercise to fit hor- izontal lines to mark these extremes, which can be identified as high and low cut-off points, or thresholds For example, extreme zones are used for partitioning the infor- mation into one of three brackets: bullish; neutral, and bearish: For those who prefer subtle gradations, any number of zones could be identified and weighted according to historical statistical significance. But most source data is so "noisy" that it needs to be smoothed or normalized first: If the data migrates over time, trending higher or lower; moving average bands may be fitted around the data to mark extremes (See Envelopes: Further; if the source data contains wide variations in volatility; adaptable stan- dard deviation bands may be fitted to the data to mark extremes. (See Bollinger Bands: - Overboughtloversold models frequently rely on Bracket Rules. Such indicators often give extreme signals in advance of an actual top or bottom. This leading indica- tor characteristic can allow overboughtloversold models to be used as screens, or Bay good Breadth Advance/Decline Indicator: Breadth Thrust 123 permission filters, permitting other models' signals to be acted upon only when both are in the same mode, either both bullish for a buy signal or both bearish for a sell signal. Since a market sometimes hits an overboughtloversold extreme and the extreme trend still continues, a variation on overboughtloversold zones is to recognize a sig- nal only when two conditions are observed: first; there must have been an extreme reading (overboughtloversold) for n periods with the value of n to be determined by historical research); and second, the actual or sell signal is recognized when the data finally exits the extreme zone. Thus, this method acts only when the pressure producing the extreme level lifts. This may offer a safer entry more closely timed to an actual trend reversal: Another variation is shifting O dynamic bracket levels, which change according to the readings of a separate model used to modify and to filter the bracket rule. Breadth Advance/Decline Indicator: Breadth Thrust The Breadth Advance/Decline Indicator was developed by Martin Zweig: It is a 10- day simple moving average of the ratio of the number of advancing issues divided by the sum of the number of advancing issues plus declining issues. It is usually calcu- lated based on issues listed on the New York Stock Exchanges, and similar indicators may be calculated for other markets, such as the NASDAQ: The indicator can be ex- pressed by the following formula, before applying the 10-day simple moving average: Z = (AJA + D) where Z = today'$ 1-day ratio of advances to total issues exhibiting any change at all A = number of advancing issues D = number of declining issues The cumulative equity graph shows that from 7/22/32 to 3/30/94 (for trades oly with no shorting) the Breadth Advance/Decline Indicator gave steadily profitable buy and sell signals when it made an extreme directional thrust; thus con- firming powerful market momentum: When the 10-day simple moving average reached extremes, above 0.659 for a signal, and falling below 3.66 for a sell signal, it to follow the momentum: Account equity rose steadily, with no drawdowns_ However; since 3/30/94, there have been no signals. The chart of the indicator shows that it has not reached as high as 0.66 since 1/6/92. It is apparent that the be- havior of the underlying statistics have changed so that the 10-day moving average of the A/(A + D) no longer reaches the high levels it had. We must conclude that this buy point price long rising buy paid 124 Technical Market Indicators formerly useful indicator; which depended more on the level rather than the trend of the underlying data, has not adapted to the changing behavior of the breadth data. Trend is More Important than Level for the Breadth Advance/Decline Indicator The trend of the Breadth Advance/Decline Indicator is an effective indicator; although not as profitable as the Advance-Decline Line. Based on a 68-year file of daily data for the number of shares advancing and declining each day on the New York Stock Exchange and the Dow-Jones Industrial Average since March 8, 1932, we found that the simplest possible trend-following rule would have produced a positive result o a purely mechanical signal basis with no subjectivity, no sophisticated technical analy- and no judgement: Enter Long (Buy) at the current daily close of the Dow-Jones In- dustrial Average when Breadth Advance/Decline Indicator rises relative to its level the previous Close (Sell) at the current daily price close of the Dow-Jones Indus- trial Average when the Breadth Advance/Decline Indicator falls relative to its level the previous Enter Short (Sell Short) at the current daily price close of the Dow-Jones Industrial Average when the Breadth Advance/Decline Indicator falls rel- ative to its level the previous Close Short (Cover) at the current daily close of the Dow-Jones In- dustrial Average when the Breadth Advance/Decline Indicator rises rela- tive to its level the previous Starting with $100 and reinvesting profits, total net profits for this Breadth Ad- vance/Decline Indicator trend-following strategy would have been $2,159,426, as- suming a fully invested strategy, reinvestment of profits, no transactions costs and no taxes.

(See Contrary Opinion and Advisory Service Sentiment._ Bullish Consensus is tabulation of market opinions expressed in published mar- ket letters distributed widely by futures brokers and advisors.

McCurtain. It may be computed using daily or weekly data. McCurtain designed CPFL to reflect the direction option money is flowing: The relative importance of an options transaction needs to be weighted by the dollar value of the transaction that is, times volume. In contrast; conventional Call-Put analysis treats all call and put volume equally; that is, 1000 contracts of an option trading at 1/16 has the same importance as 1000 contracts of an option priced at 25. McCurtain corrects this error by multiplying the option price by the option volume to arrive at the dollar value of the transaction. One thousand contracts at 25 would have dollar value of $250,000, which is 400 times greater than the dollar value of $6,250 for the at 1/16. Assuming that the at 1/16 is more likely to reflect the hopes of a wild gambler; while the at 25 is more likely to reflect the considered strategy of a serious professional, McCurtain'$ times volume weighting places the emphasis where it belongs If stock volume leads price, and volume offers further clues to future stock movements, then McCurtain reasoned that when CPFL starts a new trend before the price of the underlying issue, the stock price should follow. Also, if the stock price rallies to new highs while CPFL fails to rise, option dollar flows are rela- tively weak, and price strength should not continue. Similarly, if the stock price falls to new lows and CPFL does not confirm that price weakness by also making new lows, option dollar flows are relatively strong, and the stock price decline should be temporary. McCurtain'$ Call-Put Dollar Value Flow Line (CPFL) may be computed in seven steps: 1. Collect end-of-day closing and volume data for all call and all put op- tions of the underlying stock; index, or commodity to be analyzed. Since most publications do not publish complete details for all options, McCurtain collects his data electronically for all strike and all maturities for each issue. 2_ Multiply each call s volume by its closing 3. Sum the products (from 2) for each call option for each issue to arrive at the day'$ Call Dollar Value. 4 Multiply each put s volume by its closing 5. Sum the products (from 4) for each put option for each issue to arrive at the day' s Put Dollar Value: price option option option price option price price prices option` price. Step option price. Step Call-Put Dollar Value Flow Line (CPFL) 131 6. Subtract the Put Dollar Value from the Call Dollar Value, for the Net Call- Put Dollar Value. Respect the sign, so if Call Dollar Value is less than Put Dollar Value, the Net Call-Put Dollar Value will carry a minus sign: 7_ Calculate a cumulative total of the Net Call-Put Dollar Values (from 6). This cumulative total will rise when Call Dollar Value is greater than Put Dollar Value, and it will decline when Call Dollar Value is less than Put Dol- lar Value. Indicator Strategy Example for McCurtain's Call-Put Dollar Value Flow Line Historical data shows that the Call-Put Dollar Value Flow Line can offer accurate sig- nals on the side. Based on the weekly call and put data for S&P 100 Stock Price Index and the Dow-Jones Industrial Average for 18 years from March 1983 to Janu- ary 2001, we found that the following parameters would have produced (for trades only) a moderately positive result on a purely mechanical trend-following sig- nal basis with no subjectivity, no sophisticated technical analysis, and no judgement: Enter Long (Buy) at the current weekly price close of the Dow-Jones In- dustrial when the weekly Call-Put Dollar Value Flow Line crosses above its previous week's trailing 114-week Exponential Average of the weekly Call-Put Dollar Value Flow Line. Close Long (Sell) at the current weekly price close of the Dow-Jones In- dustrial when the weekly Call-Put Dollar Value Flow Line crosses below its previous week's trailing 114-week Exponential Average of the weekly Call-Put Dollar Value Flow Line. Enter Short (Sell Short) never: Starting with $100 and reinvesting profits, total net profits for this Call-Put Dol- lar Value Flow Line strategy would have been $832.45, assuming fully invested strategy, reinvestment of profits, no transactions costs and no taxes.

Chande Momentum Oscillator (CMO) The Chande Momentum Oscillator (CMO) is a momentum oscillator that is closely related to RSI (Relative Strength Index) in its method of calculation: CMO uses data for both up days and down days in its numerator; calculations are applied on unsmoothed data, then the ratio is smoothed. But in contrast to RSI, which is bounded within a range of 100 to 0, the CMO indicator scale is bounded by +100 and ~ 100, with default overboughtloversold thresholds at +50/-50. Like other oscillators, CMO may be interpreted in a variety of ways. CMO was presented by Tushar Chande and Stanley Kroll, The New Technical Trader, John Wiley & Sons, New York, 1994, 256 pages. Indicator Strategy Example for CMO CMO appears to produce results similar to RSI Naive testing assumptions suggest that CMO may have some objective value as purely mechanical, contra-trend tech- nical indicator; 50 as buy signal and +50 as sell signal. The majority of oversold buy signals would have been profitable, although the winning percentage is less than that of RSI. Moreover; these signals would have been robust, with all CMO lengths from to 31 profitable and right most of the time (for trades only) . As attractive as high percentage of profitable trades may seem, it is important to note that CMO (like other contra-trend strategies) failed to provide any protection in the Crash of '87, the decline of 1998,and other significant market price drops As the chart shows, there are sharp equity drawdowns. Using CMO for contratrend over- sold and overbought signals underperformed the passive buy-and-hold strategy for long trades only, while short selling would not have been profitable.

System close drawdown 8 is the largest decline in the cumulative equity line below the initial investment; based on closed-out positions only: System open drawdown (SODD) is the largest decline in the cumulative equity line below the initial investment when a position is open. Max open trade drawdown is the largest decline in the cumulative equity line below the trade entry price during the worst single trade. The Profit/Loss Index is a complex calculation that relates the Amount of Winning Trades to the Amount of Losing Trades on a scale 8 of 100 (worst possible performance) to 100 (best possible performance) , with zero representing profits equal to losses. Reward/Risk Index is the Total net profit minus System open drawdown. The resulting difference is then divided by the Total net profit: The Buy/Hold Index is the Total net profit minus the buy-and-hold strategy's net profit: resulting difference is then divided by the buy-and-hold net profit: In this exercise, initial equity is assumed to be $100_ Both long and short positions are taken unless otherwise noted: Trades are executed at the closing price on the signal date.

Merrill, CMT; who has many decades of experience as both a professional statistician and technical analyst: The chi-squared test is a standard statistical test used to deter- mine if the patterns exhibited by data could have been produced by chance. For a sim- ple two-way test (one with only two possible outcomes such as right Or wrong), the formula for the chi-square test with the Yates Correction is: (((lal el _ 0.5)2yel) + (((la2 _ e2 0.5)2y/e2) where L._ the absolute value of the expression within, that is, ignoring sign al actual observed frequency of outcome 1 el expected or theoretical frequency of outcome 1 a2 actual observed frequency of outcome 2 e2 expected or theoretical frequency of outcome 2 Merrill offers an actual example based on all trading days for 31 years from 1952 to 1983. The number of actual observed Mondays when the market rose was 669. The number of actual observed Mondays when the market fell was 865. The to- tal number of all Mondays was 1534. Since 52.19 of all trading days were up over this period, the expected frequency of up Mondays would be the total number of all Mondays multiplied by that expected frequency, which is 1534 multiplied by 52.19, or 799. The expected frequency of down Mondays would be the total number of all Mondays at 1534 multiplied by 47.99 (that is, 100% minus 52.19), which is 735. This is all the data we need to plug into the above chi-squared formula: (((Ial el = 0.5)2yel) + (((la2 _ e2 / _ 0.5)2)e2) (((/669 799 0.5)29/799) + (((l 865 735 0.5)29/735) ((129.529/799) + ((129.529/735) = (16770.25/799) + ((16770.259/735) = 20.99 + 22.82 = 43.81 The chi-squared test result, 43.81,is highly significant at the 99.9% confidence level; that is, the probability is less than 1in 1000 that the actual observed outcome was due to random chance alone. Generally; chi-squared test results are interpreted as follows: Chi-squared test results from zero to and including 3.84 are insignificant; that is, the probability is at least 1 in 20 that the actual observed outcome was due to random chance alone. Chi-Squared Test of Statistical Significance 151 Chi-squared test results above 3.84 are probably significant at the 959 confi- dence level; that is, the probability is less than 1in 20 that the actual observed out- come was due to random chance alone. Chi-squared test results above 6.64 are significant at the 99% confidence level; that is, the probability is less than 1 in 100 that the actual observed outcome was due to random chance alone. Chi-squared test results above 10.83 are highly significant at the 99.9% confi- dence level; that is, the probability is less than in 1000 that the actual observed out- come was due to random chance alone Generally, cross tabulations allow identification of relationships between vari- ables, and the Pearson chi-square test is the most common test of significance to de- termine the relationship between variables. Basically, we observe actual outcomes and compare them with expected frequencies assuming no relationship between variables. As trivial example of a simple binomial experiment, suppose we a fair coin to forecast the direction of the stock market: Since there could be no relationship between this naive forecast and any actual outcome, we expect about an equal num- ber of correct and incorrect forecasts. In other words, the difference between actual observed outcomes and expected outcomes should approach zero as we increase our sample size. (When the expected outcome is 50/50, chi-squared reduces to the square of the difference of the actual observed number of heads minus the actual observed number of tails; then that squared difference is divided by the sum of the actual ob- served number of heads plus the actual number of observed tails.) If we next test an actual technical indicator; the difference between actual ob- served outcomes and expected outcomes should be significant if the indicator has any real value_ The actual observed outcomes should deviate from 50/50 pattern ex- pected for a naive forecast: Statistical significance increases proportionately to the de- gree that actual observed outcomes and expected outcomes differ from an equal number of correct and incorrect forecasts. The chi-square test depends on the overall number of observations. Relatively small deviations of actual observed frequencies from the expected pattern prove more significant as the number of observations increases_ On the other hand, when the ex- pected cell frequencies fall below 5, probabilities cannot be estimated with sufficient precision. For small samples with expected frequencies less than 10, accuracy can be improved by using the Yates Correction, which reduces the absolute value of differ- ences between expected and observed frequencies by 0.5 before squaring: flip 152 Technical Market Indicators Circuit Breakers, Daily Price Limits, Trading Halts, Curbs The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), reacting to the 23% stock market crash of October 19,1987,imposed circuit breakers Or trading limits de- signed to cap maximum stock market price declines in a single day. These limits in- hibit price declines in phases, first curbing New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) program trades then, if the decline continues, eventually halting all U.S. equity, Op- tions and futures activity The purpose of these limits is to put a break on emo- tional panic that may occur within any single giving investors time to calmly assess the situation. Circuit breakers do not prevent prices from dropping more than 30 percent spread out over any time period greater than one NYSE Rule 8OA states that when the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA falls OT rises 2% from its previous day'$ close, index arbitrage orders in S&P 500 stocks must be stabilizing; that is, sell plus (sell orders on plus ticks) in weak market; or minus (buy orders on minus ticks) in a strong market The 2% value is reset at the beginning of each quarter based on averaged levels of the DJIA over the previous quarter: Further; the NYSE declares trading halts at minus 10%, 209 and 309. If the DJIA declines 10% before 2:00 p.m. (eastern time) , trading halts for one-hour: If the DJIA declines 10% between 2:00 p.m: and 2.30 p.m , trading halts for thirty minutes. After 2.30 p.m,, the 10% limit is not in effect: If the DJIA declines 20% before 1:00 p.m: trading halts for two-hours.

At minus 10% after 2.30 p.m. (eastern time) , futures trading may occur only at O above this 10% limit for 102 minutes. Then, trading will halt for two minutes if the primary futures contract is limit offer at the end of 102 minutes. A similar halt takes effect at minus 159.

Also, each component indicator should be analyzed and followed separately to allow the technical analyst to perceive possible changes in each indicator's behavior; which have been substantial over time for some indicators, due to structural changes in the trading environment: An overwhelmingly number of possible technical indicator combinations exist. For example, assume we pick just 10 indicators from this book and we choose to examine all combinations of these indicators. We would need to examine 10 to the 1Oth power number of combinations, or 10 billion combinations. Commodex Trend Index is an example of how complex indicator combinations can become. This index employs crossovers of a fast and a slow moving average, vol- ume and open interest momentum for trend confirmation, trading band for a overboughtloversold levels for taking, liquidation based on money manage- ment, and inverse pyramiding: Moreover; the components of the are weighted differently, with the longer term elements given greater weight There are many other combined indicator systems that are even more complex And the more complex the indicator combinations, the more difficult the final system is to comprehend and to work with: It is quite easy to combine different indicators in way that prevents understanding of how the combination actually works. Moreover; chain of indicators is no stronger than its weakest link The number of possibilities mushrooms when we assign variable weights to dif- ferent indicators. William Eckhardt, a trader and mathematician, stated that assigning weights tends to be assumption-laden regarding the relationship among the indicators. The literature 0n robust statistics implies that the best strategy is not an optimized weighting scheme, but is a system to weight each indicator by 1 or 0. If the indicator is enough to be used, it is weighted equally. If not good, it is excluded entirely: For stimulating interview with Eckhardt; see Schwager; J,, The New Market Wiz- ards, 1995, New York: Harper-Collins, 512 pages, p. 109. An alternate   approach is used by Arthur A_ Merrill, CMT, who has decades of experience as both a professional statistician and technical analyst. Mer- rill observes that at any given time some indicators are bullish while others are bear- ish, and it is only human nature to see only those that confirm our preconceived opinion. Merrill's solution to this problem is to objectively weight the indicators by past performance. First, he measures each indicator by its accuracy in forecasting the direction of the Dow-Jones Industrial Average over 1, 5, 13,26,and 52 weeks ahead, giving progressively greater weight to the longer time periods, which generally prO- vide the most accurate forecasts. Then, Merrill defines accuracy by the number of correct forecasts divided by the total number of forecasts. He further quantifies large stop; profit system good many 154 Technical Market Indicators accuracy by the chi-squared test of statistical significance with one degree of free- dom. Merrill translates this significance data for all of his indicators into weights pro- portional to the logs of chi-square, which is his own original innovation. Finally; he divides the sum of all bullish weights by the sums of all bullish plus all bearish weights for a totally objective weight of the statistical evidence he calls the Technical Trend Balance.

Lambert: CCI is equally applicable to stocks despite the word commodity in its name. Mathematically, the CCI formula is represented as: CCI = (M Ay/(0.015 * D) where M = (H + L + C)/3 = simple mean price for a period. H = highest for a period. L = lowest for a period. C = closing for a period. A n-period simple moving average of M: D = mean deviation of the absolute value of the difference between mean price and simple moving average of mean prices, M A. CCI creates an index similar to a statistical standard score measuring the price excursions from the mean as a statistical variation. It may be calculated in six steps: 1. Calculate each S mean the high plus low plus close divided by 3. 2_ Calculate the simple moving average of the means from results de- rived in 1_ 3_ From each period s mean (calculated in Step 1), subtract the simple moving average of the mean (calculated in Step 2). 4 Compute the mean deviation, which is the sum of the absolute values of the differences in 3_ 5_ Multiply the mean deviations by 0.015. 6. Divide the result of Step 3 by the result of 5. (The mean price-moving average differences are divided by 0.015 times the mean deviations.) Most of the random fluctuations of the CCI are supposed to fall within +100% to 100% channel. Movements beyond +100% to 100% are supposed to be nonrandom. Therefore, such movements may create trading opportunities. days. day price price price price price period' n-period Step price n-period prices Step Step large - g Commodity Chanel Index Crossing 100 Equity (10,917) 10000 10000 5000 5000 Commodity Channel Index (+100%, -100%) Trend-Following Strategy Cumulative Equity Line for Longs and Shorts Semi-Log Scale 15000 15000 10000 10000 5000 5000 Dow-Jones Industrial Average Daily Price Close Semi-Log Scale bgzo  11g4o {1950 {1960 11970 {1980 11990 Commodity Channel Index Total net profit 10816.84 Open position value NJA Net Profit/Buy&Hold % 136.42 Percent gain/loss 10816.84 Annual percent gain/loss 150.26 Annual Net %/B&H % 136.44 Initial investment 100 Interest earned Current position Out Date position entered 9/7/00 BuylHold profit 4575.25 Days in test 26276 # of per trade 12.48 Buy/Hold pct gain/loss 4575.25 Annual B/H pct gain/loss 63.55 Total closed trades 2105 Commissions paid Avg profit per trade 5.14 Avg Win/Avg Loss ratio 1.68 Total long trades 1210 Total short trades 895 Long Win Trade % 43.31 Winning long trades 524 Winning short trades 349 Short Win Trade % 38.99 Total winning trades 873 Total losing trades 1232 Total Win Trade % 41.47 Amount of winning trades 66846.78 Amount of losing trades 56029.91 Net Profit Margin % 8.80 Average win 76.57 Average loss 45.48 Average P.

Sell when CCI falls below + 100%. Sell short when CCI falls below 1009 . Cover short when CCI rises above 100%. Indicator Strategy Example for the Commodity Channel Index Historical data shows that the Commodity Channel Index can be an effective indica- tor on both the long and short sides, but particularly on the side. Based on the daily for the Dow-Jones Industrial Average for 72 years from 1928 to 2000,we found that the following parameters would have produced positive result on purely mechanical trend-following signal basis with no subjectivity, no sophisticated technical analysis, and no judgement: Enter Long (Buy) at the current daily price close of the Dow-Jones In- dustrial Average when CCI (14) rises above +lOO%. Close (Sell) at the current daily price close of the Dow-Jones Indus- trial Average when CCI (14) falls below +100% . Enter Short (Sell Short) at the current daily close of the Dow-Jones Industrial Average when CCI (14) falls below 100% . Close Short (Cover) at the current daily close of the Dow-Jones In- dustrial Average when CCI (14) rises above 100% . Starting with $100 and reinvesting profits, total net profits for this CCI strategy would have been $10816.84, assuming a fully invested strategy, reinvestment of prof- its, no transactions costs and no taxes. This would have been 136.42 percent better than buy-and-hold. Short selling, which was included in this strategy, would have lost money since October; 1987,but nevertheless, would have been profitable over the en- tire 72-years as a whole Trading would have been active at one trade every 12.49 cal- endar The Equis International MetaStockS System Testing rules are written as follows: Enter long: CCIoptl) 100 Close CCI(optl) 100 Enter short: CCI(optl) 100 Close short: CCI(optl) ~100 OPTI Current value: 14 long ` Buy long long prices Long price price days: long: Commodity Channel Index Crossing Zero: Zero CCI 159 Commodity Channel Index Crossing Zero: Zero CCI Lambert'$ original Commodity Channel Index (CCI) was designed with a neu- tral zone between +100% and 100%. This keeps the CCI system out of the market substantial part of the time, most importantly at some critical turning points, when price can move rapidly Thus, CCI misses the very early phases of new trends These early phases are often the most dynamic. By relaxing the plus and minus one hundred filter (+100% and 100% _ and switching to crossings of the neutral zero line for and sell signals, the problem of is overcome. Under our assumptions, results would have been more profitable. Indicator Strategy Example for ZERO CCI Historical data shows that the ZERO CCI can be an effective indicator on both the and short sides, but particularly on the side. Based on the daily prices of the Dow-Jones Industrial Average for 72 years from 1928 to 2000, found that the fol- lowing parameters would have produced a positive result o purely mechanical trend-following signal basis with no subjectivity, no sophisticated technical analysis, and no judgement: Enter (Buy) at the current daily price close of the Dow-Jones In- dustrial Average when ZERO CCI (2) rises above 0%. Close Long (Sell) at the current daily price close of the Dow-Jones Indus- trial Average when ZERO CCI (2) falls below 0%. Enter Short (Sell Short) at the current daily price close of the Dow-Jones Industrial Average ZERO CCI (2) falls below 0%. Close Short (Cover) at the current daily close of the Dow-Jones In- dustrial Average when ZERO CCI (2) rises above O%. Starting with $100 and reinvesting profits, total net profits for this ZERO CCI strategy would have been $1,238,397.90, assuming a fully invested strategy, rein- vestment of profits, no transactions costs   and no taxes_ This   would have been 26,967.33 percent better than buy-and-hold. Short selling; which was included in this strategy; would have lost money since August, 1982, but nevertheless, would have been profitable over the entire 72-years. Trading would have been hyperactive at one trade every 3.61 calendar days.

The Profit/Loss Index is a complex calculation that relates the Amount of Winning Trades to the Amount of Losing Trades on a scale of 100 (worst possible performance) to 100 (best possible performance) , with zero representing profits equal to losses. Reward/Risk Index is the Total net profit minus 8 System open drawdown. The resulting difference is then divided by the Total net profit: The Buy/Hold Index is the Total net profit minus the buy-and-hold strategy's net profit: resulting difference is then divided by the buy-and-hold net profit: In this exercise, initial equity is assumed to be $100_ Both long and short positions are taken unless otherwise noted: Trades are executed at the closing price on the signal date.

The CSI is the Average Directional Movement Index Rating (ADXR) multiplied by the Smoothed True Range (STR) multiplied by a constant that represents the mon- etary movement potential for each futures contract (K): CSI ADXR * STR K The CSI begins with Directional Movement (DM), defined as the largest part of the current period $ range that lies outside the previous period $ range. Thus, PDM = H Hp MDM = Lp - L where PDM positive O plus DM MDM negative Or minus DM: H highest price of the current period. Hp = highest price of the previous period. Lp = lowest of the previous period: L lowest price of the current period. The lesser of the above two values is reset to equal zero_ That is, if PDM is than MDM, then MDM is reset to equal zero_ Or; if MDM is greater than PDM, then PDM is reset to equal zero. Also, any negative number is reset to equal zero_ Therefore, on an inside day (with lower high and higher low), both PDM and MDM are negative numbers, so both are reset to equal zero True   Range (TR) is defined as the   largest   value of the   following three possibilities: TR = H - L, or TR = H - Cp, or TR = Cp - L where Cp is the closing of the previous period. price price price greater price Commodity Selection Index (CSI) 163 Before proceeding, all data is smoothed by an exponential smoothing constant: Wilder suggests an exponential smoothing constant of 1/14, or 0.07143, which is roughly equivalent to a 27-day simple moving average. (This smoothing is used in all of the following calculations. The Positive Directional Indicator (PDI) is the exponentially smoothed Di- rectional Movement divided by the smoothed True Range. Thus, PDI = SPDMISTR Smoothed PDMSmoothed TR Remember; when Lis greater than H Hp, then PDM is reset to zero, SO PDI must decline. The Minus Directional Indicator (MDI) is defined by the following exponen- tially smoothed data: MDI SMDMISTR Smoothed MDM/Smoothed TR Remember; when Lp Lis less than H Hp, then MDM is reset to zero, SO MDI must decline. Next; Directional Movement (DX) is defined as one hundred times the absolute value of the daily difference of PDI minus MDI divided by the sum of PDI plus MDI: DX 100 PDI MDI I(PDI + MDI) Average Directional Movement (ADX) is a 0.07143 exponential smoothing of DX The Average Directional Movement Index Rating (ADXR) smoothes the ADX So, it further smoothes an already smoothed indicator: ADXR is the sum of the most recent ADX plus the ADX reading 14 periods previous, and then that sum is divided by two. Next, we look up specific futures contract information needed to calculate K, a constant that represents the monetary movement potential for each futures contract, according to the following formula: K = VIM * (1/(150 + C)) 100 where V = the value of a one cent price fluctuation, expressed in dollars M = margin, expressed in dollars C = commissions, expressed in dollars The CSI is the ADXR multiplied by the STR Smoothed True Range) , and the resulting product is multiplied by K, leading us to the formula for CSI: CSI = ADXR STR * K Plus Lp 2 #Vol/Ol (0.9174) 0.90 0.85 0.80 0.75 Confidence Index 0.70 Moody's Bond Yields 0.65 Aaa / Baa W Monthly Averages 0.60 0.55 0.50 15000 10000 50001 Dow-Jones Industrial Average Confidence Index Equity 4) 750 700 Cumulative Equity Line 650_ Longs Only for 600 Confidence Index Moody's Bond Yields Aaa Baa 550 Monthly Averages 500 450 400 350 300 250 2001 150 100 8 Whe (707 _ 166 Technical Market Indicators Confidence Index The Confidence Index, developed in 1932 by Barron $, is one of the oldest sentiment indicators. It is calculated by dividing the average of high grade conservative bonds by the average yield of intermediate grade speculative bonds. The Confidence Index is based on logical observation: when investors feel confident about future economic conditions, are more willing to put their money in riskier; more speculative bonds As a result; yields on grade bonds decrease, and so the Confidence Index rises. But when investors worry about the future of the economy, they shift their funds from speculative bonds to safer; higher-grade bonds. Thus, yields on lower grade bonds rise relative to yields on higher grade bonds, and so the Confidence Index falls. Furthermore, it seems logical that there should be a positive correlation between bond confidence and stock market sentiment. When investors are confident; take chances on riskier bonds and stocks, which are also quite dependent on future eco- nomic conditions. We tested these ideas the ratio of Aaa bond yields on the highest rated cor- porate bonds divided by Baa bond yields on lower corporate bonds from Moody' s Investor Service. Refer to the charts on the preceding two pages. We examined monthly average yields back to January 1932. The chart on page 164 shows the ratio of Aaa yields to Baa yields fell to a low of 0.4873 in 1932, during the dark days of the Great Depression, when investor confidence was at an ex- treme low. High grade bond yields were less than half of lower bonds, and grade bond yields were more than double the yields of the highest grade bonds. By January 1966, confidence was running high, and the ratio of Aaa to Baa cor- porate bond yields rose to 0.9368. High grade Aaa bond yields were only 6.329 less than lower Baa bond yields. In the 36 years from 1932 to 1968, the Cumulative Equity Line shows an up- ward change in the trend of the Confidence Index as a profitable indicator for a only strategy: We the Dow-Jones Industrial Average at month end when the Confidence Index turns higher; and we exit positions and go into cash when the Confidence Index turns down_ Over the most recent 32 years, after testing variety of trend filters, we found that a strategy of trading equities based on the rises (buying long) and declines (exit- long positions and going into cash) in the Confidence Index would not have been profitable. For a long or cash strategy, the chart shows the Cumulative Equity Line in August; 2000, was actually lower than it was in December; 1968. Selling equities short based on Confidence Index would have been extremely unprofitable. Although the Confidence Index produced profits for a long-only strategy in the distant past, it no longer offers worthwhile possibilities for timing the equity market: yield they lower they using grade May; grade lower grade long- buy long ing falling Contrary Opinion: The Art of Contrary Thinking 167 Contrary Opinion: The Art of Contrary Thinking Sometimes called the Theory of Contrary Opinion, the idea that we should do the op- posite of what the majority is might more properly be called The Art of Con- trary Thinking, after the book by Humphrey B. Neill. (Neill, H. B. (1954). The Art of Contrary Thinking, Caldwell, Idaho: Caxton Printers . Thanks to the influence of Robert J. Farrell, technician at Merrill Lynch for sev- eral decades, contrary thinking has become popular ~perhaps excessively so. Appli- cation of contrary thinking is not simple, and it is widely misused. In the words of top-performing hedge-fund manager; George Soros; "There are many events that ac- tually occur in spite of the fact that were widely anticipated It has become fashionable to be a contrarian, but to bet against prevailing expectations is far from safe Events tend to reinforce prevailing expectations most of the time and contra- dict them only at the inflection points, and inflection are notoriously difficult to identify. Now that the contrarian viewpoint has become the prevailing bias, I have become a confirmed anti-contrarian. (Soros, George, The Alchemy of Finance, John New York; 1994,378 pages, pages 307-308. Indeed; we have confirmed some basis in fact for fading contrarians. (See Advisory Service Index: "Contrary opinion is usually ahead of time;" according to Humphrey B. Neill. ~The public is perhaps right more of the time than not The public is right during the trends but wrong at both ends Identifying the right spot to go against the thundering herd is not always easy. Momentum can carry much further than is reasonable. That is where the Art comes in. Neill advised us to look at all sides of any question and challenge the popular view, saying The weight of popular predictions causes their own downfall:' The un - derling logic is that a market cannot accommodate the vast majority of participants thinking the same way and the same thing: When everybody is bullish, there is no one left to and when everyone is bearish, there is no one left to sell: So, it is time for a trend reversal. The problem in actual practice is that there is never anything close to 100% consensus of opinion to fade. Scientists who study human behavior confirm that people lose their individual- ity and critical faculties when they join a large crowd o mob. A crowd functions on an extremely primitive, emotional, impulsive, and irrational level. Herd behavior is unthinking: There is a basic part of the human makeup that is social, gregarious, and SO people are willing to bond to the group and follow it unquestioningly and thought- lessly. Perhaps this quality has some group survival value under certain circum- stances; but it can be quite costly to the individual when engaged in trading markets The at which the crowd seems to reach its height of emotional frenzy is sometimes a turning point; but the precise timing is not easy to determine. One clever trader bought call options the Friday before the Monday Crash of 87. He was con - vinced that the stock market was oversold, everyone was bearish, and stock doing they points Wiley; prices doing buy; point prices 168 Technical Market Indicators were overdue for a rebound. He was right within two trading but that two made all the difference. He lost most of his money as the market totally collapsed the very next trading Instead, if he had waited two trading days, ideally buying on Tuesday after lunch, he would have made a fast and fortune instead of one There are many technical indicators f the Sentiment and Overbought/Oversold classes that attempt to objectively quantify excessive crowd opinion and, perhaps more importantly, behavior; since people do not always do what say: So, contrary opinion has become & popular notion, bandied about loosely by television commentators, whose general level of understanding of technical analysis is superficial. Many experienced technical analysts use sentiment; but more as sup- plement to trend, momentum, and other technical indicators than as stand-alone, signal generator: Sentiment typically shows overbought and oversold levels well be- fore the directional move is over and, therefore, can be misleading: In general, sentiment is a background indicator that is not useful for precise timing: John Bollinger points out that thinking contrary alone is not sufficient. Rather; effective use depends on a crowd held together by a falsity until something startles them. There must be a widely held opinion that is incorrect or becomes incorrect, and catalyst that creates the conditions for a reversal of that opinion. (John A.

Coppock Curve (Coppock Guide) The Coppock Curve quantifies changes in longer-term smoothed price momentum in order to identify significant stock market  bottoms. It was designed by Edwin Sedgewick Coppock, who published it in Barron $ in 1962. Coppock's original ex- pression is a 10-month weighted moving average of the sum of the 14-month rate of change plus the 11-month rate of change for the S&P 500. Signals are recognized when this smoothed momentum changes direction from down to up (buy) and from up to down (sell). Divergences of smoothed price momentum versus itself are also analyzed. daily closing price data and 21 trading days for an average month; the MetaStock custom formula language for the Coppock Curve could be expressed as follows: ((Mov((ROC(Mov(C,21,5),231,%, ROC(Mov(C,21,8),294,9))/2 ,210,W)));Input("Plot a horizontal line at" -100,100,0); days; days day: large losing they price price price Using Coppock Curve (Coppock Guide) 169 Indicator Strategy Example for Coppock Curve Changing Direction Using the Coppock Curve formula applied to a 101-year file of daily data for the Dow-Jones Industrial Average from January 1900 to 2001, we found that the fol- lowing parameters would have produced modest result on purely mechanical trend-following signal basis with no subjectivity, no sophisticated technical analysis, and no judgement: Enter Long (Buy) at the current daily price close of the Dow-Jones In- dustrial Average when the Coppock Curve is greater than the previous day' $ exponential moving average of the Coppock Curve.

Of course, a very large number of variations are possible Coppock'$ original formula had five variables, but we can Te- duce this number to three and obtain more robust and more profitable results with fewer and milder drawdowns in cumulative net equity Using MetaStock@ formula language, the following might be just one possible adaptation of smoothed momen- tum slope with fewer variables (three versus five) for use with daily data: Mov(ROC(Mov(C,21*2,E),21*2*2*5,9),21*2*5,E) Input("Plot a horizontal line at -100,100,0); of these parameters can be allowed to vary. In this specific example, this formula translates into just three steps: 1. Compute a 42-day Exponential Moving Average of the daily closing prices. 2 Compute a 420-day percentage Rate of Change of the 42-day Exponential Moving Average from the first step. 3 Compute a 210-day Exponential Moving Average of the 420-day Rate of Change from the second step. A signal is recognized when the slope of the smoothed rate of change (from the third step) turns from down to up. A sell signal is recognized when the of the smoothed rate of change (from the third step) turns from up to down_ The result is plotted on the chart pages previous, page 172. Based on the same 101-year file of daily data for the Dow-Jones Industrial Av- erage from January 1900 to 2001, we found that these three parameters would have produced a positive result on purely mechanical trend-following signal basis with no subjectivity, no sophisticated technical analysis, and no judgement: Enter Long (Buy) at the current daily price close of the Dow-Jones In- dustrial Average when the slope of the smoothed rate of change turns from down to up. Close (Sell) at the current daily price close of the Dow-Jones Indus- trial Average when the slope of the smoothed rate of change turns from up to down_ Enter Short (Sell Short) never: Any buy slope two May Long Cumulative Equity Line 175 Starting with S100 and reinvesting profits, total net profits for this Smoothed Momentum Slope Indicator trend-following strategy would have been $78,681.33, assuming a fully invested strategy, reinvestment of profits, no transactions costs and no taxes. This would have been 263.49 percent greater than buy-and-hold. No short selling would have been profitable, so no short selling was included in the strategy Long-only Smoothed Momentum Slope as an indicator would have given profitable buy signals 62.509 of the time. Trading would have been relatively inactive at one trade every 578.50 calendar Note on the chart that there are fewer and milder drawdowns in cumulative net equity than with the Coppock Curve.

For illustration purposes in this book, we consistently start with S1OO and reinvest net profits after every closed-out or short transac- tion. A loss on trade causes the Cumulative Equity Line to fall proportionately. To simplify our analyses, we exclude variables such as transactions costs, margin, inter- est and taxes. In the real world of trading, the Cumulative Equity Line would be graphical representation of our account'$ net worth, and net of variable costs. In this book, the Cumulative Equity Line rises and falls strictly according to the indicator'$ efficiency in correctly identifying direction. Technical analysis of the Cumulative Equity Line can be a useful money man- agement tool.

While we use basic indi- cators to exploit trends in market prices, we can apply similar indicators to our Cu- mulative Equity Line, exploiting trends in the performance of basic indicators to take full advantage of friendly market environments as appear The Cumulative Equity Line also could be used to select among basic indica- tors. A visual inspection of the direction, and smoothness of the Cumulative Eq- Line chart and the relative size of drawdowns offers a chart reader a quick, but very sense of the critical Reward/Risk performance characteristics of an indica- tor: Also, standard statistical tests of the variance of the Cumulative Equity Line of an indicator can be used as a supplement to visual inspection: This quantifies the mance to allow different indicators (tested over different time periods and under somewhat different assumptions) to be objectively compared by a common standard. Cumulative Volume Index The Cumulative Volume Index is a running total of the daily net differences between Advancing minus Declining stock volume, similar to the Cumulative Daily Advance- Decline Line. A rising trend in the index indicates increasing net demand relative to supply for stocks, and that is bullish: A trend in the index indicates increasing net supply relative to demand for stocks, and that is bearish: Technical analysts gen- erally use New York Stock Exchange data published on page C2 of The Wall Street Journal and other major newspapers. (See Volume: Cumulative Volume Index of the Volume of Advancing Issues Minus the Volume of Declining Issues:_ Cycles of Time and Price Cycle analysts study time as it relates to data generated by the markets. Cycle is de- rived from the Greek word kuklos; which means circle. A cycle is a recurring interval of time within which a round of regularly repeated events is completed. Cycle ana- lysts apply past precedents of time duration between past events, such as the time be- tween market price lows, in order to estimate the probabilities of the future course of prices and to make educated estimates of how long a particular trend might last: Only approximately 15% of the members of the Market Technicians Association admit to cycles in their work: Some technicians think cycles should be consid- ered a separate area of study.

Western culture prefers the illusion that each individual can completely control his life. Yet our lives are inevitably shaped, even predetermined, by cycles. Every being's life is prescheduled and pre-scripted within actuarially predictable ranges of time. Planet earth undergoes cyclical changes daily, seasonally and over vast expanses of time. Geophysicists, drilling into rock layers down in the earth; can measure these changes in thousands and tens of thousands of years_ Some scientists hypothe- size that our ancestors endured periodic ice ages, and our progeny will deal with future recurrences_ Also, the earth' $ orbit takes it through an asteroid belt that has caused collisions responsible for mass extinctions of earthly life forms, and the earth will pass through this asteroid belt and according to very long-term Ancient people were closely tied to the natural world and accepted the cyclical facts of life. Survival demanded sowing, reaping, and engaging in animal husbandry in conformance with natural cycles, although most modern urban dwellers do not give it much thought: More than two millennia ago, Pythagoras of Samos recognized the cyclical nature of the vibrations known as music, which he extended to music of the spheres, the harmonic motion of the lights in the sky that are more than clocks. The movements of the sun, the moon and the stars literally define our notions of time here on earth: Our ancestors made extraordinary efforts to build remarkable monuments, such as Stonehenge, to mark the cycles of these lights in the sky: Observed Stock Market Cycles Market cycles are fractal, with smaller within larger There are ex- tremely long and extremely short With many in different time frames at work at the same time, analysis can become extremely complex . Shorter-term are subordinate to longer The intraday market cycles, measured in minutes, are subject to minor cycles, measured in days. These are subject to direc- tional domination by intermediate secondary cycles measured in weeks, which in turn are dominated by the long-term major cycles measured in months, which are subject to still longer cycles measured in years, decades, centuries, millennia, and so on Limiting ourselves to daily close-only data over the past 52 years, from 1949 to 2001, the Dow-Jones Industrial Average has changed direction every 3.39 calendar on average. Twice that is 6.78 calendar days.

Twice that is 20.19 calendar days for the full cycle Therefore, a minor-cycle trader might look for system that signals about three times a month: As the Observed Cycle Lengths table (on the facing page) shows, trading fre- quency declines exponentially as we increase our percentage filter linearly: There appears to be a break at the 8% filter: Filters larger than g% produce di- minishing reductions in average days of trade duration: Therefore, a movement of &9 might be considered an objective for an investor who wishes to maximize re- turns without being glued to the daily fluctuations. If we filter out movements of less than &%, the Dow-Jones Industrial Average has changed direction every 186.97 calendar on average. Twice that is 373.94 calendar days for the full cy- cle. That also translates to 53.42 weeks, or 12.29 months, or 1.02 This 1-year is with intermediate-term traders, who try to capture &% movements and seek a trading system that signals about twice a year: The &% filter table (on page 180) shows the dates of all g% filter; 1.02-year high and low turning points. The Observed Cycle Lengths table (on the page) illustrates various actual average cycle lengths between significant market price lows (bottoms) in the Dow- Jones Industrial Average, over the past 52 years, price change filters of various sizes to reduce noise. Average lengths give us only a rough estimation of underlying rhythms, since there is a great deal of variability hidden by av- eraging: Therefore, these cycles should be regarded as mere tendencies rather than as any kind of accurate clocks. Nesting Cycles: Cycles Within Cycles Nesting cycles were described by J.M. Hurst; Profit Magic of Stock Market Transac- tion Timing, Prentice Hall, New York, 1960. Combinations of cycles of different lengths account for some of the observed variability in cycles Hurst observes that cy- cles of different lengths tend to converge at significant market price bottoms The more different cycles that coincide, the greater the tendency for an important bottom to form. Hurst suggests that different intervals can be averaged to form model that might suggest possible turning for trends. Hurst demonstrates proportionate relationship between the following cycles: the 10-week cycle, two of which make a 20-week cycle; 20-week cycle, two of which make a 40-week cycle; and a 40-week cycle, two of which make an 80-week Cycle lengths fairly close to these appear in our table of Observed Cycle Lengths In addition, from the same table, note proportionate relationships between the following Observed Cycle Lengths: trading price point price price days; years. cycle popular cycle price cycle facing again using cycle cyclical cyclic cycle points price cycle. we Cycles of Time and Price 179 Observed Cycle Lengths Size Number Average Full Full Full Full of of Cycle Cycle Cycle Cycle Filter Trades Duration in Days in Weeks in Months in Years % 5569 3.39 6.78 0.97 0.22 0.02 1% 1871 10.09 20.19 2.88 0.66 0.06 2% 943 20.03 40.05 5.72 1.32 0.11 3% 581 32.50 65.01 9.29 2.14 0.18 4% 395 47.81 95.62 13.66 3.14 0.26 5% 271 69.68 139.37 19.91 4.58 0.38 6% 195 96.84 193.68 27.67 6.36 0.53 7% 143 132.06 264.11 37.73 8.68 0.72 % 101 186.97 373.94 53.42 12.29 1.02 % 83 227.52 455.04 65.01 14.95 1.25 10% 65 290.52 581.05 83.01 19.09 1.59 11% 60 314.73 629.47 89.92 20.68 1.72 12% 51 370.27 740.55 105.79 24.33 2.03 13% 43 439.16 878.33 125.48 28.86 2.40 14% 35 539.54 1079.09 154.16 35.45 2.95 15% 33 572.24 1144.48 163.50 37.60 3.13 16% 28 674.43 1348.86 192.69 44.32 3.69 17% 23 821.04 1642.09 234.58 53.95 4.50 18% 21 899.24 1798.48 256.93 59.09 4.92 19% 21 899.24 1798.48 256.93 59.09 4.92 20% 17 1110.82 2221.65 317.38 72.99 6.08 25% 13 1452.62 2905.23 415.03 95.45 7.95 30% 7 2697.71 5395.43 770.78 177.26 14.77 35% 7 2697.71 5395.43 770.78 177.26 14.77 40% 3 6294.67 12589.33 1798.48 413.61 34.47 Two cycles of 1.02-years (based on an 8% price filter) sum to 2.04 years; which compares to the observed 2.03-year (based on a 12% price filter).

Juglar'$ cycle forms Long Long Long Long Long cycle Cycles of Time and Price 181 the basis of the Decennial Pattern, a 10-year cycle, and of the Juglar Wave, a 9.25- year cycle in stock prices. This has repeated 16 times since 1834. Ian Notley; using the Bartels test of probability, found that the 9.25-year cycle could not occur by chance more than once in 5000 times. Note that 8 to 10 years is about half the 17.70 of war: (See Cycles of War: ) Every 9 solar years, the angles 0- and 180 between the sun, moon, and the moon s nodes repeat to within one degree, according to David McMinn, author of Fi- nancial Crises & The S6-Year Cycle, Twin Palms, Blue Knob 2480, Australia. (See Astrology, Financial Applications of Astronomical Cycles:) Our 25% filter (from our table Observed Cycle Lengths) reveals a 7.95-year cy- cle. This 7.95-year cycle is about twice the well-known 4-year A simple mov- average of 7.95-years effectively smoothes out nesting of 7.95-years or less  The 4-Year Cycle (Kitchin Wave) and the 49- to 58-Year Wave (Kondratieff Wave) Two cycles of 2.03 years (from our table Observed Cycle Lengths) sum to 4.06 years, and four cycles of 1.02 years sum to 4.08 years. The 4-year cycle was known by traders such as the Rothschilds for more than a century: In 1923, Harvard Professor Joseph Kitchin showed 4-year influences in bank clearings, wholesale prices, and interest rates in Great Britain and in the U.S. for the period 1890 to 1922. Bill Meridian relates the 4-year to both the U.S. presidential election and the Mars-Vesta (See Astrology, Financial Applications of Astronomical Cycles:) The 4-Year Cycle table (on the next page) illustrates actual observed lengths between significant market lows for the Dow-Jones Industrial Average from 1896. These bottoms mostly appear before mid-term elections in the US. The column labeled Time (years) represents the time duration between important lows ex- pressed in years (including fractions of years converted to decimals) and is the dif- ference between the more   recent date and the previous date listed on the line immediately above_ Approximately thirteen 4-year cycles make up the Long Wave, which ranges from 49- to 58-years This cycle in economic data was discovered in 1847 by Clarke. Later; it was rediscovered by W.S. Jevons and N.D Kondratieff. We already noted (in Nesting Cycles) that three cycles of 17.7 years to 18.24 years sum to 53.10 years to 54.72 years, which is well within the range of the Long Wave. Since 1885, the Long Wave has averaged 53.94 years between market price lows or bottoms for the U.S. stock market The Long Wave table (on page 183) shows all of the available data.

If that bottom is vi- olated, it could suggest substantial downside risk for U.S. equity markets.

Cycles of War and the Long Wave of 49 to 58 years Cycles of war relate to economic and financial cycles, particularly cycles of inflation, deflation, recession, and depression. Anticipation of war; particularly fear of war; is bearish for stock prices. Investors obviously hate war: Although the number of ob- servations is far from sufficient to establish statistical validity, there may be a Long Wave ranging from 49 to 58 years for U.S. involvement in wars: 58 years after the outbreak of the French and Indian War of 1754 followed the outbreak of the War of 1812 between the U.S. and Britain: Year Day '9 cycle price price Inc , 184 Technical Market Indicators 49 years after the outbreak of the War of 1812 followed the outbreak of U.S. Civil War in 1861. 53 years after the outbreak of the U.S. Civil War in 1861 followed the out- break of World War [ in 1914. 52 years after the outbreak of Spanish-American War in 1898 followed the outbreak of Korean War in 1950. 53 years after the outbreak of World War I in 1914 followed the major U.S. Vietnam War offensive and the Middle East War; both in 1967. 51 years after Germany invaded Poland on September 1, 1939, thereby World War II, invaded Kuwait on August 2, 1990. Both were fol- lowed by U.S. war preparations and subsequent U.S. participation in war: 49 years and 41 days after the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor on December 7_ 1941,an US-led coalition bombed on January 17, 1991. Cycles of War and the 17.70-Year Cycle The Foundation for the Study of Cycles has substantiated the periodicity of the fol- lowing historic data sets, some of which may be related: 17.70-year in War; dating back to 600 BC 17.50-year in U.S. Wholesale Prices. 18.00-year in Bituminous Coal Production. 17.33-year in the Flood Stages of the River Nile. Three cycles of 17.70 years are 53.10 years (17.70 times 3 is 53.10), which cO- incides fairly closely with the Long Wave in U.S. stock prices, averaging 53.94 years. One third of the 53.94-year Long Wave in U.S. stock is 17.98 years. Confining our investigation to the U.S. only, starting with the American colonial militiamens' first Revolutionary War battle with British troops at Lexington and Con - cord, Massachusetts, on April 19, 1775, and counting forward in time, there have been 12 full cycles of 17.70 years: The U.S. was involved in the Civil War in 1863,at the end of the fifth cycle of 17.70 years (17.70 times 5 is 88.50 years). The U.S. was involved in World War I in 1916, at the end of the eighth cy- cle of 17.70 years (17.70 times 8 is 141.60 years). The U.S. was involved in the Korean War in 1952, at the end of the tenth of 17.70 years (17.70 times 10 is 177.00 years). The U.S. was involved in the Vietnam War in 1970, at the end of the eleventh cycle of 17.70 years (17.70 times 11 is 194.70 years). The thirteenth cycle of 17.70 years (17.70 times 13 is 230.10 years ends in 2005 .

We found 28 directional up Or down trends of 109 O greater: These 10% yield swings lasted a median time duration of 609 calendar days or 20.01 months, or 1.67 years. Twice the swing dura- tion of 1.67 years gives a full cycle of 3.34 years Although the median gives US one pleasing and precise number; it is important to note that there has been a great deal of variation in the time duration of the yield swings, from a minimum of 0.17 years max- imum of 12.09 years. Fibonacci Time Cycles Robert C. Miner proportions future time by Fibonacci ratios First, Miner applies Fi- bonacci Time-Cycle Ratios to the time duration of the latest completed using both trading days and calendar The most important Fibonacci ratios are: 0.382, 0.500, 0.618, 1.000, 1.618- 2.000, and 2.618. Miner' $ Alternative Time Projections are calculated as time ratios of the ous in the same direction, that is, up swings are measured out as prOpOI - tions of previous up while down swings are measured out as proportions of previous down swings. Also, Alternative Time Projections may be derived from same-direction price swings earlier than the latest one. Miner points out that there is a very high probability of trend change when both price and time ratios coincide. Miner's Trend VibrationTM method is based on two directional movements early in a trend: the initial thrust and the initial corrective wave of that thrust: Together; these two movements are Elliot Waves one and tWO, and Miner calls them the initial vibration. Fibonacci ratios of that initial vibration time projected forward coincide with subsequent turning dates, including the end of the completed trend.

D. Gann, Miner also uses multiples of 30 (specifically, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180,210, 240, 270, 300, 330, and 360), and multiples of 36 (specif- ically, 36, 72, 108, 144, 180, 216, 252, 288, 324, and 360) in his counts. Anniversary dates of previous turning in history also add value to his analysis of time. Miner also uses Bollinger Bands (which are also known as Standard Deviation Bands and Volatility Bands) to help identify and confirm timelprice turning points Two standard deviations above and below a moving average create a channel that en- closes 959 of the action. In relatively low volatility, sideways trading-range markets, such bands reliably indicate support and resistance. In trending markets, where the trend is strong and continuing, reactions against the trend often do not ex- ceed the moving average mid-way between the upper and lower bands. In a bullish trend, spends more of the time testing the upper band and the moving average. In a bearish trend, spends more of the time testing the lower band and the mov- ing average. At the independently determined cyclical time of probable trend Miner has observed that price is often near one extreme band or the other: Then, to confirm the trend change, moves quickly to the opposite band, in the direction of the new trend, showing a relatively high degree of absolute price velocity.

The most obvious outliers and errors should stand out and away from the rest of the data and can be checked on a case by case basis. Spot check the rest of the data against an independent data source. The rule for back testing is to search out the most data and the most accurate data available. We can never have too much data. A data base allows Walk- Forward Simulation, a powerful analytical technique. When working with different independent data series, such as a sentiment indi- cator used for and sell signals to be used against stock prices, take special care that the data points line up in correct order: Pasting both data series onto a spread sheet makes misalignment easy to see. Economic data are usually reported with a such that data labeled for the month of January are actually reported in February or March: Therefore, we must ad- vance the data as of the labeled date forward by the amount of the time in report- The dates of actual market prices must line up with the dates the economic data were actually reported, and not the labeled dates. We must not paper trade on data that is not yet available at the time of the signal. We must insist that our simulations are realistic, otherwise, we are ourselves. For example, buying on the date of the end of an economic recession and selling on the date of the beginning of an economic recession would have been a profitable strategy, if we could actually execute it; but we cannot. Adjusting for the in economic data reporting, profits for a recession- timing strategy evaporate. Data Exploration, Data Mining Data exploration is an inevitable part of the discovery process. We must establish spe - cific, well-defined analytic procedures designed to explore large amounts of raw data to find trends, patterns O relationships between variables. If an algorithm is found, it can be applied to detect signals in out-of-sample, unseen data. Then, if that is fruitful, an actual trading program might be launched. An example of one of our most used data exploration routines is the Exponential Moving Average crossover rule to detect elementary directional trends. When data mining is used properly, it is an important step in the development of a technical indicator At graphic long buy lag, lag ing: fooling lag 190 Technical Market Indicators Days of the Month Arthur Aj Merrill, CMT; pioneered the study of seasonal behavior of stock market prices in his classic book; Merrill, A.

Measuring each specific date of the month, from the Ist to the 3lst, Merrill found a significant bullish bias in the first six calendar days of the month and in the last three calendar days of the month: He found that the stock market lagged in the middle of the month, in terms of in winning frequency, the percentage of We independently collected our own statistics for the past 100 years from 1900 to 2000. Our findings support the study Merrill conducted 17-years earlier: Our num- bers (on the facing page) show a probable rise in each of the last two and first two cal- endar days of each month: The rest of the days were more likely to go down than to go up. Although days were more frequent; the size of the were bigger than the size of the losses As shown in the Percentage Gain (~Loss) column, only 14 of 31 calendar days actually would have lost money (on average), while 17 of the 31 cal- endar days would have money for transactions. And the days would have lost less money per day than the winning days would have made money per day: So, not only do we need to consider the frequency of an observation, but also the magnitude of a price movement. Note some variability in the total number of trades is due to years, holidays, and weekends. The New York Stock Exchange was closed from July 31 to December 11, 1914, due to fears of selling imbalances as result of the outbreak of World War I.Also, before 26, 1952, the market was open on Saturdays. Indicator Strategy Example for the of the Month Historical data shows that a simple strategy based on the of the month can pro- duce positive results, but only on the long side. The short side would have lost money over the past 100 years and especially since 1974. Based on the daily closing for the Dow-Jones Industrial Average for 100 years from 1900 to 2000, we found that the following parameters would have produced a positive result on a purely mechan- ical trend-following signal basis with no subjectivity, no sophisticated technical analysis, and no judgement: Enter (Buy) at the current daily close of the DJIA each month when the calendar says the is the 26th, or on the next trading ses- sion if the market is closed on the 26th.

Measuring each specific day of the week (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thurs- and Friday) , Merrill found a strong bullish bias on the last three calendar days of the trading week, namely Friday; Wednesday and Thursday ~in that order: He found Tuesday to be only slightly positive, while Monday was a losing day more often than not. Merrill found that on average the DJIA increased 52.1% of the time each day of the week Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays did not deviate significantly from the norm, respectively rising 50.5%, 55.29, and 53.2% of the time. Mondays and Fri- days were more significant: Mondays were bearish with the market rising only 43.69 of the time; and Fridays were bullish with the market up 57.79 of the time. We independently calculated our own statistics for the past 48 years from Mon- 26, 1952, through Wednesday; November 22, 2000. Our findings completely supported Merrill '$ findings on the frequency of win- ning days. Results conformed precisely to the order of his ranking: Friday was the best followed by Wednesday, Thursday, and Tuesday, which, again, was only slightly positive. Monday was still a losing more often than not, and Monday was only negative day of the week. However; the frequency of losing Mondays was not as bad as Merrill found in his test 17 years earlier; probably because of the great bullish stock market uptrend from 1982 to 2000. price prices price each day day; ` day; May day; day quite Days of the Week 199 s&P 500 MARKET PROBABILITY CHART 2001 THE CHANCE OF THE MARKET RISING ON ANY TRADING DAY OF THE YEAR" (Based on the number of times Ihe S&P 500 rose on a parlicular trading day during January 1953-December 1939) JANUARY FEBRUARY MARCH 75 35 30 75 APRIL MAY JUNE 65 55 75 JULY AUGUST SEPTEMBER 60 35 75 OCTOBER NOVEMBER DECEMBER 35 Shows the number of trading days in each month (Saturdays; Sundays, and holidays excludad) {or 2001 Graphic representalion of page 188 See new trends developing on pages 76, 94. 96 and 134 Reprinted by permission of Yale Hirsch, Stock Traders Almanac, The Hirsch Organization, Inc , 184 Central Avenue, Old Tappan, NJ 07675, WWW. stocktradersalmanac com_ 8 Days Of Week, Buy Monday, Sell Friday Equity (13,106) 15000 10000 5000 Days of the Week, Monday, Sell Friday Cumulative Equity Line for Longs Only Semi-Log Scale 10000 5000 Dow-Jones Industrial Average Daily Price Close Semi-Log Scale MimiMimrimimaniifhincuttinimi umni Vemeaenm-tumeeed JMamrtmmMt TiriINM -tat Titmtmf eetsIn"TT4rtTunmmatTmtttTM: TmmttimTMTTt TTT 4etiniIaM 'TIi"Itt7} WnhIt TantttMmn*nimmtmammmMamM MIT -IMENMMIn MMTI IIAgIMAFUMUOMuH MHM 52 54 55 56 57/-58 59_60 61 62 63 64 85_86_67_68j "7077171722"7337174"7157,7787,77"78"79180 81" 82"83184 85 86 87 88,89 90.91 92 93 94 95_96_97_98_99_005 Buy Days of the Week; Friday,; Sell Monday Total net profit 13006.5 Open position value 79.78 Net Profit/Buy&Hold % 239.05 Percent gain/loss 13006.5 Annual percent gain/loss 268.02 Annual Net %/B&H 239.05 Initial investment 100 Interest earned Current position Long Date position entered 11/20/00 BuylHold profit 3836.15 Days in test 17713 # of per trade 7.28 Buy/Hold pct gain/loss 3836.15 Annual BIH pct gain/loss 79.05 Total closed trades 2434 Commissions paid Avg profit per trade 5.38 Win/Avg Loss ratio 0.9 Total long trades 2434 Total short trades Long Win Trade % 56.82 Winning long trades 1383 Winning short trades Short Win Trade % #DIV/O!

Monday was the only of the week that lost money: Note that before Monday; 26, 1952, there was trading o Saturdays. In- cluding data before 5/26/52 would have distorted test results. Therefore, the earliest data before 5/26/52 was excluded from this study.

When the market is closed on Monday, it does not enter a trade. Indicator Strategy Example for the Days of the Week The best strategy is obvious from the table: on Monday's close, and sell on Fri- day's close. Historical data shows that this simple strategy (based on the of the week) can produce positive results, on the side only. Although the short side would have made money over the past 48 years, short selling would have lost money since 11/30/87 , and so short selling was not included in the results shown_ Based on the daily closing for the Dow-Jones Industrial Average for 48 years from 26, 1952, through November 22, 2000, we found that the following parameters would have produced a positive result on purely mechanical trend-following signal basis with no subjectivity, no sophisticated technical analysis, and no judgement: Enter Long (Buy) at the current daily close of the DJIA each week when the calendar says the is Monday; Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thurs- whichever comes first: This range of dates is necessary to avoid skip- ping trading in a week because Monday falls on a holiday: Close (Sell) at the current daily price close of the DJIA each week when the calendar says the day is Friday If there is no Friday in a week due to a holiday, hold until the next Friday: Enter Short (Sell Short) never: day May leap buy day long prices May price day day; Long Decennial Pattern, Decennial Cycle 203 Starting with $100 and reinvesting profits, total net profits, long oly, for this of the Week strategy would have been $13,006.50, assuming a fully invested strategy, reinvestment of profits, no transactions costs and no taxes. This would have been 239.05 percent greater than buy-and-hold. About 56.82 percent of the 2434 nals would have produced winning trades. Short selling, which was not included in this strategy; would have been made money from 1952 to 1987 but would have lost money since 11/30/87 The Equis International MetaStock System Testing rules are written as follows: Enter DayOfWeek()=optl OR DayOfWeek() -optl+1 OR DayOfWeek() -optl+2 OR DayOfWeek() =optl+3 Close DayOfWeek()-opt2 OPTI Current value: 1 OPT2 Current value: 5 Decennial Pattern; Decennial Cycle By tradition, each year is numbered. The Decennial Cycle is based on the observation that the digit that is at the end of the year marker may have something to do with stock performance.

As the chart by Ned Davis Research on page 205 shows, there has been a fairly steady and substantial declining trend from a top in the fourth quarter of year nine to major market low in the mid- dle of year two. There has been a brief but sharp rally in the third quarter of year two_ Following that brief rally, stock prices have worked higher into year four: Year five has been strongly up without significant corrections. There have been moderate COr- rections in year six. Stock prices have moved modestly higher into the third quarter of year seven, then sharp correction into year end. Year eight and the first three quarters of year nine have been strongly up again without significant corrections.

The ninth year deserves honorable mention, up 75% of the time. The first year has been up two-thirds of the time. that end in zero, such as 2000 and 2010, have been by far the worst years for the Dow-Jones Industrial Average. The zero year has been down eight times out of 12 since 1881, including most recently 1990 and 2000. The eight declines were in the range of 4% to 349, with a median loss of 139.

It was designed by James Sibbet to be a leading indicator of price change. According to Thomas E. Aspray. (" Fine-Tuning the Demand Index;' Technical Analysis of Stocks & Commodities, Vol. pp. 141-143, www.traders.com) , DI is based the ratio of Buying Pressure (BP) to Selling Pressure (SP) If BPis greater than SP; then the ratio is assigned a positive sign. But if SP is greater than BP; then the ra- tio is assigned a negative sign: If today' $ rises, Buying Pressure BP) is defined as total volume, while Selling Pressure (SP) is defined as today'$ total volume divided by today's adjusted change in On the other hand, if today' $ declines, SP is defined as today's total volume, while BP is defined as today'$ total volume divided by today's adjusted change in Today's adjusted change in is defined in two parts: first, compute the percentage change from yesterday'$ close to to- day' s close; second, multiply this percentage change by three times today'$ volatility-adjusted price. Today'$ volatility-adjusted price is today '$ closing di- vided by a 10-day average of price range. Price range is defined as the highest high minus the lowest low for the latest two trading Fortunately, the complex formula for DI is preprogrammed in the MetaStock software exactly the same as Sibbet'$ original, except for different y-axis scaling from +100 to 100. (The original was plotted on a scale labeled +O at the top, 1 in the middle, and ~0 at the bottom:  DI is interpreted in standard momentum oscillator fashion. DI crossing Zero confirms price trend change. More subjectively a divergence between DI and price suggests change in trend. Extreme high readings in DI indicate very strong demand, and in that case, further rally attempts are probable. When DI hovers near zero for a long time, demand and supply have reached balance, and minor fluctuations do not last or amount to much: Indicator Strategy Example for the Demand Index (DI) Historical data shows that the simple Demand Index crossing zero would have prO- duced positive results, mainly on the side. The short side would have lost money over the past 18-year bull market: Based on the number of shares traded each on the New York Stock Exchange and the daily prices for the Dow-Jones Industrial Av- erage for 72 years from 1928 to 2000, we found that the following parameters would have produced a positive result on purely mechanical trend-following signal basis with no subjectivity, no sophisticated technical analysis, and no judgement: price change , 4.4, price price. price price. price price price price days. price long long day DiNapoli Levels; Fibonacci Profit Objectives 209 Enter Long (Buy) at the current daily close of the DJIA when the current Demand Index is greater than Zero. Close Long (Sell) at the current daily close of the DJIA when the current Demand Index is less than zero. Enter Short (Sell Short) at the current daily close of the DJIA when the current Demand Index is less than zero_ Close Short (Cover) at the current daily close of the DJIA when the current Demand Index is greater than zero. Starting with $100 and reinvesting profits, total net profits, long and short, for this Demand Index strategy would have been S83,643.62, assuming a fully invested strategy, reinvestment of profits, no transactions costs and no taxes. This would have been 1,728.18 percent greater than buy-and-hold. Only about 31.30 percent of the 1818 signals would have produced winning trades, and the average open trade would have lasted 14.45 calendar days on average. Short selling, which was included in this strategy, would have lost money since 1982.

Welles Wilder; Jr., in his 1978 book New Concepts in Technical Trad- Systems (Trend Research, PO Box 128, McLeansville, NC 27301). DMI is a rather complex trend-following indicator: Wilder has asserted that markets exhibit strong trends only about 30% of the time. To avoid the unprofitable frustration of at- tempting to follow trends in a sideways market, Wilder devised DMI as a filter that permits entry into trades only when markets exhibit significant trending characteris- tics. When a market fails to exhibit significant trending or directional behavior; DMI keeps investors out of the market By use of exponential moving averages and ratios, DMI tames high, low, and close data down to a scale that ranges from zero to 100. Directional Movement (DM) is defined as the largest part of the current period $ range that lies outside the previous period '$ range. Thus, PDM H Hp MDM = Lp - L where PDM positive or plus DM: MDM = negative O minus DM. H the highest price of the current period. Hp = the highest of the previous period. Lp the lowest price of the previous period. L the lowest price of the current period. The lesser of the above two values is reset to equal zero That is, if PDM MDM, then MDM is reset to equal zero. Or; if MDM PDM, then PDM is reset to equal zero. Also, any negative number is reset to equal zero. Therefore, on an inside (with lower high and higher low), both PDM and MDM are numbers, so both are reset to equal zero. True Range (TR) is defined as the  largest  value of the  following three possibilities: TR = H -L TR = H - Cp TR = Cp - L where Cp is the closing of the previous period. Before proceeding; the PDM, MDM and TR are smoothed with an exponential smoothing constant: Wilder suggests an exponential smoothing constant of 1/14, or ing price price price price negative day price Directional Movement Index (DMI) 213 0.07143, which is roughly equivalent to a 27-day simple moving average This smoothing is used in all of the following calculations. The Positive Directional Indicator (PDI) is the exponentially Smoothed Plus Di- rectional Movement divided by the exponentially Smoothed True Range. Thus, PDI SPDMISTR Smoothed PDM/Smoothed TR Remember; when Lp Lis greater than H Hp, then PDM is reset to zero, SO PDI must decline. The Minus Directional Indicator (MDI) is defined by the following exponen- tially smoothed data: MDI SMDMISTR Smoothed MDM/Smoothed TR Remember; when Lp Lis less than H then MDM is reset to zero, SO MDI must decline. Next; Directional Movement (DX) is defined as one hundred times the absolute value of the daily difference of PDI minus MDI divided by the sum of PDI plus MDI: DX 100 PDI MDI I(PDI + MDI) DX must be always contained in a range from zero (representing equality of PDI and MDI) to 100 (representing all of one and none of the other). Average directional movement (ADX) is a n-period exponential smoothing of DX. (Again, Wilder suggests the same exponential  smoothing constant;  1/14 or 0.07143.) Directional Movement Rating (ADXR) is defined as the average of today'$ ADX plus the ADX of 14 days ago, that is, the current ADX plus the 14-day-old ADX readings divided by two Wilder suggests that high and rising levels on ADX and its average, ADXR, in- dicate healthy and forceful major trend, either up O down. Low and falling levels on ADX and its average, ADXR, indicate trendless market; going nowhere. As a general guide, ADXR readings less than 20 might indicate a trendless market, while ADXR readings greater than 25 might indicate a market that is trending: Indicator Strategy Example for the Directional Movement Index Historical data shows that Directional Movement can be effective on both the and short sides, but particularly on the long side. Based on the daily for the Dow-Jones Industrial Average for 72 years from 1928 to 2000, we found that the fol- lowing parameters would have produced a significantly positive result o purely mechanical trend-following signal basis with no subjectivity, no sophisticated techni- cal analysis, and no judgement: Hp;` long prices ~ 10O00 Directional M , PDI MDI & > ADX > Mov Equity (10,089) 10000 5000 Directional Movement 5000 Trend-Following Strategy Cumulative Equity Line for Longs and Shorts Semi-Log Scale 10000 10000 5000 5o00 Dow-Jones Industrial Average Daily Price Close Semi-Log Scale 1920 '41940 '1950 50 1970 '1980 '1990 Directional Movement Total net profit 9988.57 Open position value NJA Net Profit/Buy&Hold 118.32 Percent gain/loss 9988.57 Annual percent gain/loss 138.75 Annual Net %/B&H 118.33 Initial investment 100 Interest earned Current position Out Date position entered 9/7/00 BuylHold profit 4575.25 Days in test 26276 # of per trade 6.93 Buy/Hold pct gain/loss 4575.25 Annual BIH pct gain/loss 63.55 Total closed trades 3790 Commissions paid Avg profit per trade 2.64 Win/Avg Loss ratio 1.64 Total long trades 2030 Total short trades 1760 Long Win Trade % 44.43 Winning long trades 902 Winning short trades 685 Short Win Trade % 38.92 Total winning trades 1587 Total losing trades 2203 Total Win Trade % 41.87 Amount of winning trades 65866.3 Amount of losing trades 55877.76 Net Profit Margin % 8.20 Average win 41.5 Average loss 25.36 Average P.

Divergence Analysis Divergence analysis offers the potential for timely signals of impending trend change. But not all divergences are followed by trend change, and response times may be de- layed. In current practice, wide variety of indexes and indicators are compared against one another to look for technical divergences. Studies suggest that the larger the number of logically selected technical indica- tors that diverge, the more likely a trend reversal. Conversely, the the number of indicators that confirm an existing trend, the more likely that trend is to continue A technical divergence is present when the price of any instrument (stock, in- dex; Or contract) makes a significant price movement unconfirmed Or unaccompanied by a similar movement in a logically selected companion indicator: example, when the Dow-Jones Industrial Average makes a new high but the Dow-Jones Transportation Average and the cumulative Daily Advance-Decline Line do not confirm this strength by making new highs, then negative divergences are pre- sent, and these could have bearish implications for the near future. Conversely, if the Industrials make new low and the Transports and A-D Line do not confirm this weakness by making new lows, then positive divergences are present, and these could have bullish implications for the immediate future. Indeed, in narrow and rigorous chi-squared statistical testing, David A Glick- stein and Rolf Wubbels ( Dow Theory is Alive and Welll" , Journal of Portfolio Man- agement; Spring 1983) concluded that daily relationships from 1971 through 1980 between the Dow Jones Industrials   and  Transports and  the  cumulative   Daily Advance-Decline Line were not random but instead were statistically significant: Independently, Kalish found similar divergences that also were highly statisti- cally significant; beyond the 0.005 level, so the probability is less is than 5 in 1000 that the actual observed outcome was due to random chance alone. This also means_ of course, that it is more than 99.59 certain than these relationships did not occur by chance. (See Kalish, Joseph E,, "Divergence Analysis: Several Empirical Tests, Market Technicians Association Journal, 1986.)

Kalish'$ composite chi-squared test showed that the greater the number of indicators confirming Or diverging, the more likely it is that the market will move in the direction expected by these confirming Or diverging indicators. A Utility Divergence Indicator was developed by the Market Logic newsletter: It is computed and interpreted in the following seven steps. 1. weekly data, calculate 20-week percentage rates of change for the S&P 500 Composite Stock Price Index and the Dow-Jones Utility Average. 2_ Subtract the S&P 500 rate of change, from the Dow-Jones Utility Average rate of change. 3. Smooth that difference with a 4-week moving average. 4 Plot that smoothing: 5. Draw horizontal signal lines at 5.5 and 15. 6. the S&P 500 when the S&P 500 makes a new 125-day but the Util- ity Average does not make a new 125-day low, Or when the Utility Diver- gence Oscillator rises above 5.5. 7 Sell when the Utility Divergence Indicator falls below 15 and then rises above ~ 15. As the chart shows, this Utility Divergence Indicator gave itable signals in the past: Donchian's 4-Week Rule This rule is a specific form of the more general Price Channel Trading Range Break- out Rule, where the period length is set at four weeks. when the current high rises above the highest high over the most recent four weeks by the mini- mum unit of measurement_ Sell when the current low falls below the lowest low over   the previous  four weeks by the minimum unit of measurement. Double Exponential Moving Averages (DEMA) DEMA was designed to respond faster than EMA DEMA is a composite implemen- tation of single and double Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) producing another EMA with less than either f the original two EMAs. DEMA was introduced by Patrick G. Mulloy in 1994, "Smoothing Data With Faster Moving Averages;' Techni- cal Analysis of Stocks Commodities magazine, V 12:1, WWWtraders.com_ Using low Buy prof- Buy price price price price price price lag 220 Technical Market Indicators In our independent observations, at short period lengths, DEMA does appear to respond more effectively to changing new data than does an ordinary EMA. At longer period lengths, however; DEMA responds much less effectively than the equivalent length EMA As the table shows, DEMA underperforms EMA at period lengths of 23 days and higher: Therefore, DEMA should not be assumed to be a substitute any other moving average. Rather; DEMA may best be considered to be an unfamiliar new tool to be approached with appropriately cautious respect: The following table shows a comparison of the signal performance of a standard moving average crossover rule DEMA and an ordinary EMA of the same length, expressed in trading as measured against the S&P 500 Composite Stock Price Index futures CSI Perpetual Contract from 4/21/82 to 12/29/00.

It was de- rived from the writings of Charles H: Dow from 1900 to 1902 published in the daily newspaper he founded, The Wall Street Journal. Dow's Theory was further refined by analysts and writers S. A. Nelson, William P Hamilton, and Robert Rhea in the first few decades of the ZOth century: Seven Basic Principles of Dow's Theory: 1. Everything is discounted by the Averages, specifically, the Dow-Jones Industrial Average and the Dow-Jones Transportation Average. Since the Av- erages reflect all information, experience, knowledge, opinions, and activi- ties of all stock market investors, everything that could possibly affect the demand for or supply of stocks is discounted by the Averages. 2 There are three trends in stock prices The Primary Tide is the major term trend. But no trend moves in a straight line for and Secondary Re- actions are the intermediate-term corrections that interrupt and move in an opposite direction against the Primary Tide. Ripples are the very minor to-day fluctuations that are of concern only to short-term traders and not at all to Dow Theorists. 3_ Primary Tides going Up, also known as Bull Markets, usually have three up moves in stock The first move up is the result of far-sighted investors accumulating stocks at a time when business is slow but anticipated to im- prove. The second move up is a result of investors buying stocks in reaction buy price long- long; day- prices. Dow Theory 225 to improved fundamental business conditions and increasing corporate earn- The final up move occurs when the general public finally notices that all the financial news is During the final up move, speculation runs rampant: 4 Primary Tides going down, also known as Bear Markets, usually have three down moves_ The first move down occurs when far-sighted investors sell based on their experienced judgement that high valuations and booming cOr - porate earnings are unsustainable. The second move down reflects panic as a now fearful public dumps at any the same stock just recently bought at much higher prices. The final move down results from distress selling and the need to raise cash: 5. The two Averages must confirm each other: To signal a Primary Tide Bull Market major trend, both Averages must rise above their respective highs of previous upward Secondary Reactions To signal a Primary Tide Bear Mar- ket major trend, both the Dow-Jones Industrial Average and the Dow-Jones Transportation Average must drop below their respective lows of previous Secondary Reactions. A move to new high or low by just one Average alone is not meaningful. Also, it is not uncommon for one Average to signal change in trend before the other: The Dow Theory does not stipulate any time limit on trend confirmation by both Averages 6_ Only end-of-day, closing on the Averages are considered. Price move- ments during the are ignored: 7_ The Primary Tide remains in effect until a Dow Theory reversal has been sig- naled by both Averages. Further Helpful Elaboration on the Dow Theory The whole point of this time-honored theory is the identification of major movements of the stock market: Such major moves take quite some time to unfold, and prices change by a considerable amount. Although not specified by the Dow Theory, the Pri- mary Tide usually lasts a year to several years. Bull Markets typically run toward the longer length, while Bear Markets are shorter in duration but more violent in the ve- locity of downward movement Victor Sperandeo has quantified Dow Theory definitions. (See Sperandeo, Vic- tor; Trader Vic--Methods of a Wall Street Master; John Wiley & Sons, New York; 1991.) He found that 75% of Primary Tide Bear Markets declined from 20.4% to 47.1% in Also, 759 of Bear Markets lasted between 0.8 and 2.8 Bull Markets lasted much longer: 67% lasted between 1.8 and 4.1 years. The Secondary Wave is a reaction Or correction in the opposite direction to the Primary Tide. This intermediate-term Secondary Wave typically lasts from 3 to 13 ings: good. price they prices day price price. years . 226 Technical Market Indicators weeks. It typically retraces one-third, one-half, or two-thirds of the preceding Primary Tide swing  Sperandeo found that 659 last from 3 weeks to 3 months, and 98% last from 2 weeks to 8 months. Further; Sperandeo found that 619 retrace between 30% and 70% of the previous Primary Swing in price. The Minor Ripple typically lasts only 1 day to 3 weeks. It is ignored as in- significant noise by the Dow Theory: Sperandeo found that 98.7% last less than 2 weeks_ A Line is a narrow sideways range, extending ten calendar days or longer; the longer in time the more significant: The usual guideline to define a narrow range is approximately 5%, although William Hamilton classified a range in excess of 11% from February to June 1929 as Line. The Averages usually break out of a Line in the same direction as the Primary Tide. These breakouts are quite reliable. Al- though a Line can mark reversal to a new direction opposite to the established Pri- mary Tide, such reversal signals are much less reliable. No matter how large a move in just one Average, it would not be sufficient to indicate change in the Primary Tide unless the other Average confirmed Non - confirmations (divergences where one Average exceeds a preceding Secondary Wave reaction price extreme on a closing price basis but the other Average fails to confirm) function only as warnings to be alert for the possibility of an actual signal ahead. It is not necessary that both Averages confirm on the same or even the same month, though some authorities believe the closer the better and become more wary as the pass without confirmation. In the absence of joint confirmation by both Averages, there is no signal of major trend change ~in fact, there is non- confirmation. As a final important detail, the most minimal unit of price measure for the Av- erages (down to penny, that is, 0.01, with no rounding off) strictly counts, when comparing the current closing of each Average to its previous Secondary Wave extreme close. There are Six phases of the full bull through bear cycle: Skepticism; Grow- ing Recognition, Enthusiasm; Disbelief; Shock and Fear; and Disgust: In a major Bull Market; the first phase is accumulation of stocks at bargain prices by the smart money" (the most knowledgeable and experienced investors). Meanwhile, the mass mood toward the stock market ranges from disgust to general skepticism Stocks are depressed, and may have been for a time. Still, some in- vestors know that the always turns up, even while fundamental business condi- tions still appear grim: The smart money begins to bid for out-of-favor stocks, which are selling at temptingly low bargain prices. Transactional volume, which has been starts to improve 0 rallies reflecting the entrance into the market by these forward-looking; patient investors The second Bull phase is known as the mark-up phase. Stock rise on increasing transactional  volume. There is growing recognition that fundamental price price day days price long cycle low; prices Dow Theory 227 business conditions will improve. Stocks move up It is a very rewarding time to be in the market: The third Bull phase is marked by popular enthusiasm and speculation. Senti- ment indicators are near record levels Fundamentals now appear extremely positive. There even may be widespread talk of a "new era" of economic growth and never-ending prosperity: Stories of speculators making millions in the market flood the media. Everybody is optimistic and is buying, S0 transactional volume is ex- tremely heavy. Late in this third phase, however; volume starts to diminish on rallies, as greedy buyers shoot their wads and become fully invested, usually on margin. Also, the smart money has reminded itself that "no tree grows to the sky" and all must eventually come to an end. Consequently, those knowledgeable in- vestors, who bought early at wholesale prices, stop buying: Moreover; begin the distribution phase, parceling out their stocks at retail prices. Smart selling intensifies as the greedy but unsophisticated mob snaps up overvalued stocks at absurdly high prices Late in this game, tell-tale bearish technical cracks start to appear under the "obviously" bullish surface. Technical divergences in stocks and groups are caused by irrational buying of the wrong stocks by unsophisticated players while the smart money liquidates the best stocks. Stocks churn and make little net progress. The first Bear Market phase is marked by clear and widespread technical dete- rioration, even while almost everybody is still feeling extremely bullish: But when everyone who ever is going to has already bought; there is only one direction for prices to g0 down_ When buying power is used up, there is insufficient demand to absorb the accelerating distribution of stocks by the smart money at current prices, so have to move lower: An ever increasing number of stocks already have stalled out and formed potentially bearish chart patterns. But even as stocks break critical chart support levels, this clear bearish technical evidence is widely ignored by the un- informed masses_ After all, fundamental business conditions are still and the dips" is still the advice of the brokers and the dealers and their spokesmen in the media. The public hopes and believes that the "conventional wisdom" of all the highly compensated Wall Street analysts, strategists and economists is right Besides, the public has been told that they bought for the long term, and over the term stock prices always go up. So, stock price declines are met with general disbelief: The public would more, if only were not already fully margined. But are. So can t. The second Bear phase is marked by a sudden mood change, from optimism and hope to shock and fear: One the public wakes up and sees, much to its surprise, that 'the emperor has no clothes. Actual fundamental business conditions are not panning out to be as positive as previously hoped. In fact; there may be a little prob- lem. The smart money is gone, and there is no one left to when the public wants out. Stock drop steeply in a vacuum Fear quickly replaces Re- peated waves of panic may sweep the market: Transactional volume swells as the un- big: rapid good things they buy prices obuy rosy; paid long they buy they they day; long buy prices greed. 228 Technical Market Indicators sophisticated investor screams, me out at any Sharp professional traders are willing to bid way down in price stocks when prices drop too far too fast: The best that can be expected, however; is a dead-cat bounce that recovers only a fraction of the steep loss. The third Bear phase is marked by discouraged selling and, finally, total disgust toward stocks. Fundamentals clearly have deteriorated and the outlook is bleak: Downward movement continues but the negative rate of change eventually be- gins to slow as potential sellers liquidate holdings at distress prices. Even the best stocks, which initially resist the downtrend, succumb to the persistence of the Bear: Transactional volume, which was high in the panic phase, starts to diminish o declines as liquidation runs its course. Eventually, after everyone who is capable of selling has sold already, the Bear Market is exhausted. The discouraged public lament is, never After stocks are totally sold out, the stage is then set for the to begin When everyone who ever is going to sell has already sold, there is only one direction for prices to gO up. These phases are no secret. have been written about by Dow and his suc- cessors for more than a century: These phases repeat endlessly, over and over again. Still, the public never learns. It is all too easy, it is merely human nature, to get caught up in the mass of the moment; lose all perspective and run with the emotions of the crowd. If you do not learn how to recognize the technical indications, and if you are not disciplined, the easiest thing in the world to do is to allow yourself to be pulled along by the mass mood, the group think: But that is the way to be wrong at the crit- ical turning points, to at and sell at bottoms, and to consistently underper - form the market: To make money and outperform the market, we need to do the opposite. The Dow Theory tells us how Indicator Strategy Example for the Dow Theory The venerable Dow Theory after a century has stood the test of time. Our tests of the Dow Theory the actual historical data covering the past 101 years from Janu- ary 1900 to February 2001 confirms the importance of this major contribution to tech- nical analysis. We attempted to minimize subjectivity and judgement, and we added no other forms of analysis We checked and rechecked our signals against available published sources Based on trend confirming closing only for the Dow-Jones Industrial Average and the Dow-Jones Transportation Average, only the Seven Basic Principles of Dow's Theory exactly as enumerated above, we found very tive results for both and short signals. At Arthur A. Merrill $ suggestion (on page 84 of his Behavior of Prices on Wall Street, Second Edition; The Analysis Press, Chappaqua, NY 1984, 147 pages), we multiplied by 0.7339 all closing for the old 12-stock Dow-Jones Industrial Av- erage series to December 12, 1914,in order to make it comparable with the new "Get price! " for price price again ' cycle again. They mood buy tops against prices using posi- long prices prior Dow Theory 229 20-stock Industrial Average introduced at that time.

This would have been 3920.98 percent greater than buy-and-hold.

System close drawdown is the largest decline in the cumulative equity line below the initial investment; based on closed-out positions only: System open drawdown (SODD) is the largest decline in the cumulative equity line below the initial investment when a position is open.

"Perhaps no two students have identical ideas as to the proper classification and forecasting authority of the various price patterns which Dow and Hamilton recognized; consequently, any attempt to record and clas- sify them seemed likely to provoke controversy " Rhea warned of the dangers of self- delusion in interpreting Dow's Theory: "Critics will properly out that it is easy to produce argument in favor of Dow's Theory in such a study as we are un- dertaking; because it is easy to be wise after the event, and this contention is true Ihope that my respect for Dow's Theory is such that I will treat the subject as an im- partial observer pointing out, so far as it within my ability to do so, the places where the Averages either gave no clue to future trends or afforded erroneous impli- cations It was painful work writing confessions about one trading episode in each of the years 17, 26, 30. Dow' s Theory gave false signals in each of these years _ Dow' s Theory lacks specificity, according to Norman G. Fosback, Stock Market Logic, The Institute for Econometric Research Incorporated, 3471 North Federal Highway, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, 33306, 1976, pages 9-12. "Unfortunately, be- cause stock seldom seem to move in uniform, perfectly defined cyclical pat- terns, it is difficult to develop [specific] criteria. In fact; different Dow theorists have derived radically different criteria for Dow Theory and sell signals and have consequently derived different signal dates as well ~The Secondary Trend is often confusing its correct appraisal poses the Dow Theorist'$ most difficult problem Minor Trends are also difficult; and inferences drawn from these day-to-day fluctuations are apt to be mis- leading The charge of second guessing will continue to crop up as long as ions differ among Dow Theorists at critical periods (which is, unfortunately, often the case)_ Even the most experienced and careful Dow analysts find it necessary occa- sionally to change their interpretations when a stand first ventured is rendered unten- able by some subsequent market action," according to Robert D. Edwards and John Magee, Technical Analysis of Stock Trends, Seventh Edition, John Magee, Inc_= 103 State Street; Chicago, 1997 , 624 pages. The Dow Theory "doesn 't always give correct forecast, and the forecast isn 't always clear;' according to Arthur A Merrill, CMT, Behavior of Prices on Wall Street; Second Edition, The Analysis Press, Chappaqua, NY, 1984, 147 pages; page 81. point good lies and prices buy quite opin - 234 Technical Market Indicators The most difficult task for a Dow theorist; O any trend-follower for that mat- ter; is being able to distinguish between a normal secondary correction in an existing trend and the first leg of a new trend in the opposite direction. Dow Theorists often disagree as when the market gives an actual reversal signal;" according to John J. Murphy, CMT, Technical Analysis of the Financial Markets, New York Institute of Fi- nance, New York, 1999, 542 pages, page 29. ~When considering the results, note that these signals are the result of interpre- tation, in some cases with the benefit of hindsight Some Dow Theorists would dis- agree with my interpretation;' according to Martin J. Technical Analysis Explained, Third Edition, McGraw-Hill, New York, 1991, 521 pages, page 40 foot- note ~Making the distinction between minor reactions and secondary corrections isn 't always this clear cut; however; and is the only somewhat subjective element of Dow Theory," according to Victor Sperandeo, Trader Vic_Methods of a Wall Street Master; John Wiley & Sons, New York; 1991, page 46. AlL criticisms considered, the strengths of Dow'$ Theory far outweigh any weaknesses_ Dow Theory has proven itself over the past 100 years to be a useful, sound and profitable investment approach: Dow's Theory has made extremely im- portant contributions to the development technical analysis. Technical students would benefit greatly from a thorough study of the Dow Theory, including the detailed his- torical performance of its signals. It would be time well invested New Frontiers for Dow's Theory Considering its absence of evolutionary change, it is all the more remarkable that the Dow Theory has survived the test of time over the past turbulent century of unprece- dented events, which included two world wars, a world-wide economic depression, and mind boggling triumphs of science and technology unimaginable in Charles H: Dow' s Consider too that Dow created from scratch a predictive stock market barometer over a of just a few years, with only small quantity of primitive data and with no computer: If Charles H: Dow and his successors, S. A Nelson, William P Hamilton, and Robert Rhea, were alive today, might extend their pi- oneering work with the help of vastly more data and power to analyze that data than ever could have imagined. Properly governed by sensible discipline to insure valid procedures and logic, the computer can handle complex data far more efficiently than our unaided mental capabilities ever could. It can quickly find patterns in reams of confusing data, pat- terns that the human eye could never see and the human mind could never grasp: Since it has no emotions, and it does not care if our pet hypothesis is accepted O re- jected, the computer does not see signals that are not really there, and it does not ig- nore signals that are really there. We can not match the computer 's ability to be coldly Pring, day: period they they Dow Theory 235 calculating. It can help us to precisely define decision rules, with which we can then actually execute precisely defined actions. We must always remember; however; that because the computer lacks judgement and common sense, we must impose on it rea- sonable limitations, lest it spew forth more misleading noise than we already have to deal with: New Dow Theory Hypotheses for Computer-Assisted Testing Hypothesis One: We can use objective and precise analysis to identify a signal. Since distinguishing between Primary Tides, Secondary Reactions, and Minor Ripples is the biggest problem human analysts have with Dow's Theory, let us program our computer to define these movements by the criterion of maximization of profits. At its most basic level, excluding any qualifications O subtleties, Dow's Theory requires an advance that rises above a previous high for a signal and a decline that falls below a previous low for a sell signal, for both Averages This simplest pOS- sible definition is similar to what has been called a Price Channel Trading Range Breakout Rule. (This is also known by futures traders as Richard D. Donchian'  $ n-period trading rule and one of Richard Dennis's Turtle trading rules See Price Channel.) It is one of the oldest and simplest trend following models: we when the daily closing price moves up to a new n-period high; then we sell and sell short when the daily closing price moves down to a new n-period low. This is & pre- cisely definable model that leaves no room for doubt or fuzzy thinking: We can work with such a model: With a little imaginative database manipulation and much persistence, we were able to analyze the daily closing of both the Dow-Jones Industrial and Trans - portation Averages simultaneously in a single test, rather than just one at time, like we had to do in the old days. Specifically, we created an artificial file in Mi- crosoft Excel, where we copied the Transportation Average's closing (multiplied by 100 to avoid handling decimals) into the field (column) normally reserved for the Industrial Average's daily Volume, then we copied this file into a data file manage- ment software program, DownLoader for Windows, by Equis International, Salt Lake www.equis_com.

We found that Charles H: Dow was correct in stating that confirmation by both Averages is more significant and produces a better outcome than breakout by one Average alone. Testing only one variable length (in trading days) applied equally to both Industrials and Transports over the past 101 years, for a long-only strategy with no short selling, hypothetical net profits were highest at a 90-day length. Profits would have been more than double those of the passive buy-and-hold strategy, as shown below. But because this strategy did not approach the traditional Dow The- ory' $ results, we keep trying: The Equis International MetaStock System Testing rules, where the current Dow-Jones Transportation Average (multiplied by 100 to eliminate the fraction) is in- serted into the data field normally reserved for Volume (V), are written as follows: Enter long: C>Ref(HHV(C,optl) ,-1) AND v>Ref(HHV(Voptl) ,-1) Close long: C<Ref(LLV(C,optl) ,-1) AND V<Ref(LLV( V,optl) ,-1) Enter short: C<Ref(LLV(C,optl) ,-1) AND V<Ref(LLV( V,optl) ,-1) Close short: C>Ref(HHV(Coptl) ,-1) AND V>Ref(HHV( Voptl) ,-1) OPTI Current value: 90 Dow Price Channels of 90 Days Trade Trade Entry Close Profit # Type Date Date Loss MAE Out 1/2/00 10/20/00 Long 10/20/00 11/8/02 5.63 2 Out 11/8/02 1/21/04 Long 1/21/04 4/26/06 92.1 2.18 Out 4/26/06 8/18/06 3 Long 8/18/06 1/28/07 ~7.15 2.53 Out 1/28/07 4/24/08 4 Long 4/24/08 1/14/10 64.47 0.34 period period Dow Theory 239 Dow Price Channels of 90 Days Continued Trade Trade Entry Close Profit # Type Date Date Loss MAE Out 1/14/10 10/15/10 5 Long 10/15/10 8/10/11 11.49 Out 8/10/11 3/20/12 6 Long 3/20/12 12/4/12 6.86 Out 12/4/12 1/21/14 7 Long 1/21/14 4/23/14 9.75 2.34 Out 4/23/14 4/9/15 8 Long 4/9/15 1/31/16 94.61 4.64 Out 1/31/16 9/26/16 9 Long 9/26/16 12/21/16 37.14 11.23 Out 12/21/16 5/13/18 10 Long 5/13/18 2/3/20 64.59 4.23 Out 2/3/20 11/25/21 11 Long 11/25/21 11/13/22 84.74 0 Out 11/13/22 12/7/23 0 12 Long 12/7/23 3/3/26 241.58 5.4- Out 3/3/26 6/17/26 13 Long 6/17/26 5/27/29 628.62 7.78 Out 5/27/29 6/26/29 14 Long 6/26/29 10/23/29 91.23 22.75 Out 10/23/29 3/28/30 15 Long 3/28/30 6/9/30 142.89 33.07 Out 6/9/30 8/6/32 16 Long 8/6/32 2/23/33 238.01 14.62 Out 2/23/33 4/24/33 17 Long 4/24/33 10/19/33 122.66 1.98 Out 10/19/33 1/15/34 18 Long 1/15/34 5/5/34 46.82 4.99 Out 5/5/34 6/11/35 19 Long 6/11/35 6/14/37 381.14 Out 6/14/37 7/1/38 20 Long 7/1/38 1/25/39 39.97 6.62 Out 125/39 7/17/39 21 Long 7/17/39 1/13/40 24.58 11.25 Out 1/13/40 9/3/40 22 Long 9/3/40 2/14/41 127.29 12.08 Out 2/14/41 7/21/41 23 Long 7/21/41 10/16/41 105.21 10.99 Out 10/16/41 9/24/42 24 Long 9/24/42 11/8/43 234.7 240 Technical Market Indicators Dow Price Channels of 90 Days Continued Trade Trade Entry Close Profit # Type Date Date Loss MAE Out 11/8/43 3/11/44 25 Long 3/11/44 2/26/46 444.41 5.44 Out 2/26/46 5/28/46 26 5/28/46 7/23/46 141.19 16.48 Out 7/23/46 2/7/47 27 Long 2/7/47 4/12/47 109.05 11.98 Out 4/12/47 7/14/47 28 Long 7/14/47 9/27/48 80.95 20.21 Out 9/27/48 10/4/49 29 Long 10/4/49 6/29/51 471.09 Out 6/29/51 6/25/52 30 Long 6/25/52 4/6/53 26.37 7.39 Out 4/6/53 1/19/54 31 Long 1/19/54 10/1/56 1239.27 Out 10/1/56 7/5/57 0 32 7/5/57 8/19/57 236.29 37.94 Out 8/19/57 5/2/58 0 33 Long 5/2/58 9/22/59 1018.35 Out 9/22/59 1/12/61 34 Long 1/12/61 4/26/62 319.47 Out 4/26/62 11/9/62 35 Long 11/9/62 6/9/65 1849.33 Out 6/9/65 9/27/65 0 36 Long 9/27/65 5/5/66 250.72 38_ Out 5/5/66 1/11/67 37 Long 1/11/67 11/3/67 245.63 Out 11/3/67 5/1/68 38 Long 5/1/68 2/25/69 90.46 43.55 Out 2/25/69 10/5/70 39 Long 10/5/70 7/12/72 1149.6 23.14 Out 7/12/72 12/4/72 40 Long 12/4/72 3/22/73 716.21 101.82 Out 3/22/73 9/25/73 41 Long 9/25/73 5/22/74 954.72 152.24 Out 5/22/74 1/27/75 42 Long 1/27/75 8/20/75 806.53 Out 8/20/75 1/5/76 43 Long 1/5/76 10/8/76 540.1 Out 10/8/76 4/25/78 0 44 Long 4/25/78 10/31/78 340.53 41.14 Long Long Dow Theory 241 Dow Price Channels of 90 Days Continued Trade Trade Entry Close Profit # Type Date Date Loss MAE Out 10/31/78 3/27/79 45 Long 3/27/79 10/19/79 426.67 56.68 Out 10/19/79 7/7/80 46 Long 7/7/80 8/21/81 152.67 12.29 Out 8/21/81 8/31/82 47 Long 8/31/82 2/1/84 2168.77 6.26 Out 2/1/84 8/3/84 48 Long 8/3/84 10/16/87 7346.97 38.87 Out 10/16/87 2/29/88 49 Long 2/29/88 1/25/90 3733 130.14 Out 1/25/90 6/4/90 50 Long 6/4/90 8/17/90 1932.58 290.39 Out 8/17/90 1/18/91 51 Long 1/18/91 8/21/92 4038.77 43.56 Out 8/21/92 2/3/93 52 Long 2/3/93 3/30/94 1622.54 71.6 Out 3/30/94 2/13/95 53 Long 2/13/95 7/15/96 8205.6 Out 7/15/96 11/11/96 54 Long 11/11/96 8/4/98 11226.46 Out 8/4/98 /6/99 55 Long 1/6/99 9/23/99 3460.46 481.71 Out 9/23/99 2/16/01 Sums 46055.29 1799.29 Hypothesis Two: Period lengths should be allowed to vary according to the Or short nature of the signal. The statistical tabulations published by Robert Rhea in the 1930's and Victor Sperandeo in 1991 show that Bull Markets and Bear Markets have been much different in extent and duration. Therefore, look-back period lengths for and sell signals should not be the same. Furthermore, the requirements for each of the four possible market actions (buy sell sell short, and cover short) need not necessarily be the same. Therefore, will allow these parameters to vary Hypothesis Three: Period lengths for each Average should be allowed to vary independently. Since the historical behaviors of the Dow-Jones Industrial and Trans- portation Averages obviously differ; with the two Averages even trending in opposite directions occasionally, let us allow different parameters for each Average. long buy long, long; we 242 Technical Market Indicators Combining the three hypotheses, we completely cover all trading possibilities We allow two separate period lengths each of the four possible market actions (buy sell long, sell short, and cover short) , one period length applied to the clos- prices of the Dow-Jones Industrial Average (INDU) and a separate period length applied to the closing prices of the Dow-Jones Transportation Average (TRAN) With four possible actions (buy sell sell short, and cover short) and two Averages to test, there are eight indicators (4 X 2 = 8) to test for each model. We can vary the number of specific length values (more generally known as parameter sets for each indicator: As Louis B. Mendelsohn ( Designing and Testing Trading Systems: How to Avoid Costly Mistakes; Mendelsohn Enter- prises, 25941 Apple Blossom Lane, Wesley Chapel, FL 33544, WWWprofittaker.com) has pointed out, as we allow an arithmetic increase in the number of parameter sets (period lengths), the number of models tested increases geometrically For example, if we allow three period lengths for Our eight indicators, we test three to the eighth power =3X3X3 X 3 X 3 X 3 X 3 X 3 = 6561 models. But if we attempt to add just one more period length to our test; we jump up to four to the eighth power = 4 X 4 X 4X 4X 4X 4X 4X 4 = 65,536 models. just that one extra period length overwhelms our present software resources, which limits us to 32,000 models in a single test. Although our computing power is great compared to the past, it is still quite limited for testing complex models. Fortunately; we are not forced to limit ourselves to very coarse testing with only three broad parameters. As an alternative, we can break our testing into two halves, longs only and shorts only, testing each separately This cuts the number of indicators in each test in half, from eight to four: With only four indicators, we can test thirteen period lengths in one pass, since thirteen to the fourth power 13 X 13 X 13 X 13 28,561 models. After we develop the and short models separately, we can combine both models into one long and short model. Then we can do some final fine tuning of that combined model, indicator by indicator: Because we break apart our testing into pieces, however; we may well miss the best combination of parameter sets and our findings may be sub-optimal. After many iterations, here is what our search uncovered: Enter (Buy) when INDU rises to a new 9 trading day high and TRAN rises to a new 39 trading high: Close (Sell) when INDU falls to a new 22 trading day low and TRAN falls to a new 166 trading day low. Enter Short (Sell Short) when INDU falls to a new 22 trading day and TRAN falls to a new 166 trading day low. Close Short (Cover) when INDU rises to a new 36 trading day high and TRAN rises t0 a new 32 trading high. for long; ing long, long; price period Adding long Long day Long low day Dow Theory 243 The results are enlightening: The asymmetry of these rules means that we do not always have a position: Note that we on a very sensitive, short-term price confir- mation, only a new 9-day high for the INDU confirmed by a 39-day new high for TRAN. Thus, it is relatively easy to get a buy signal. In contrast; note that it is rela- tively hard to get sell and sell short signals: we have to wait for the INDU to fall to a new 22-day low confirmed by the TRAN falling to a new 166-day low Thus, this non-thinking model has correctly recognized the long-term bullish bias of stock market that more time going up than down and has bigger rallies than de- clines. Looking at the entire from the beginning of January 2, 1900 to February 16, 2001, the above decision rules do a consistent job of precisely defining the and sell signals. There is absolutely no doubt as to what the signals are and when and at what level the signals occur: If we could have executed this strategy over the past 101 years, we would have beaten the buy-and-hold strategy by a staggering 5637.10% . Total net would have been $1,233,454.40. This more complex trend-following rule was more active at one trade every 290.83 days on Average. Of the 127 total number of trades, 69 or 54.84% were winning trades (69 of 127 total number of trades).

System close drawdown is the largest decline in the cumulative equity line below the initial investment; based on closed-out positions only: System open drawdown (SODD) is the largest decline in the cumulative equity line below the initial investment when a position is open. Max open trade drawdown is the largest decline in the cumulative equity line below the trade 8 entry price the worst single trade. The Profit/Loss Index is a complex calculation that relates the Amount of Winning Trades to the Amount of Losing Trades on a scale of 100 (worst possible performance) to 100 (best possible performance) , with zero representing profits equal to losses. Reward/Risk Index is the Total net profit minus 1 System open drawdown. The resulting difference is then divided by the Total net profit: The Buy/Hold Indexis the Total net profit minus the buy-and-hold strategy's net profit: resulting difference is then divided by the buy-and-hold net profit: In this exercise, initial equity is assumed to be $100_ Both long and short positions are taken unless otherwise noted: Trades are executed at the closing price on the signal date.

An Exponential Moving Average crossover (see Exponential Moving Average) could be one example of a sloping line that could be applied to both the Dow-Jones Industrial and Transportation Averages to define trend and trend change signal. The exponential moving Average crossover rule would have been a profitable indicator over all time frames and, particularly, over the shorter ones. All lengths in the range of 100-days or less would have outperformed the passive buy-and-hold strategy: For traders with very low transactions costs, exponential moving Average lengths around three days would have been best. Based on the daily closing for the Dow-Jones Industrial and Transportation Averages for 101 years from 1900 to 2001, we found that the following parameters would have produced a significantly positive result on a purely mechanical trend-following signal basis with no subjectiv- ity, no sophisticated technical analysis, and no judgement: Enter Long (Buy) at the current daily price close of the Dow-Jones In- dustrial Average when this daily closing price crosses above yesterday'$ 3-day exponential moving Average of the daily closes and when the close of the Dow-Jones Transportation Average also crosses above yesterday' $ 3-day exponential moving Average of its daily closes. Close Long (Sell) at the current daily price close of the Dow-Jones Indus- trial Average when this daily closing price crosses below yesterday's 3-day exponential moving Average of the daily closes and when the close of the Dow-Jones Transportation Average also crosses below yesterday' s 3-day exponential moving Average of its daily closes Enter Short (Sell Short) at the current daily close of the Dow-Jones Industrial Average when this daily closing crosses below yesterday' $ exponential moving Average of the daily closes and when the close of the Dow-Jones Transportation Average also crosses below yesterday' $ exponential moving Average of its daily closes Close Short (Cover) at the current daily close of the Dow-Jones In- dustrial Average when this daily closing price crosses above yesterday' $ 3-day exponential moving Average of the daily closes and when the close of the Dow-Jones Transportation Average also crosses above yesterday' $ 3-day exponential moving Average of its daily closes. Starting with $100 and reinvesting profits, total net profits for this exponential moving Average crossover strategy would have been more than S505 million, assum- ing fully invested strategy, reinvestment of profits, no transactions costs and no taxes. This would have been more than two million percent better than a passive and-hold strategy. Short selling would have been profitable and was included in the prices price price 3-day 3-day price buy- Dow Theory 253 strategy: Typical of other trend-following strategies, however; short selling would have been unprofitable in the unusually large bull market from 1980 to 2000. Note that this strategy is right on only 40.369 of its signals, but the size of the a Average winning trade is 1.83 times the size of the Average trade. This exponential moving Average crossover strategy is very active at one trade every 6.35 days.

Our purpose here is not to offer any particular fix Or remake of the Dow Theory: We merely hope to stimulate thinking as to how the theory might be allowed to evolve You might use ideas herein to launch your own research: You might find your own unique guidelines in harmony with YOur own particular objectives and limitations You might develop own individual variations and interpretations, all based on the actual historical evidence. There are very large number of indicators in this book that could be used to supplement basic Dow Theory concepts. Think of how a theory evolves. observer ponders the data, forms a hypothe- sis, then tests the hypothesis. The hypothesis may be adjusted many times to better fit the data. The hypothesis also may change as new data becomes available. The hypothesis is allowed to evolve so that it describes observed phenomena better and better: Merely pondering data without testing it could lead to erroneous hypotheses, misconceptions, false conclusions and general confusion: Things that seem like ought to be true often are not when You rigorously test the hypothesis against the ac- tual data. Testing helps us clarify our thinking: Without testing, we can miss subtleties in the data and evolutionary changes in the nature of underlying phenomena over losing long: your An they 254 Technical Market Indicators time. In the absence of testing, delusions may persist: Obsolete beliefs may lead to flawed decisions. Over the years Dow's Theory has been subjected to misunderstanding due to imprecise definitions and the absence of continuous evolutionary testing: Change is constant; and no theory should be taken as etched in stone Our testing must be objective, precise, and unbiased. We must maintain strict logical control over what and how we are testing at all times Our testing must make sense. This is where experienced judgement will never be obsolete: There is compelling logic to defining and continuously redefining through back testing a of decision rules that would have performed best in the past: In fact; there is no acceptable alternative. You can theorize all you want; but without histori- cal back testing you could be on shaky ground and not know it. An objective ap- proach based on simulated performance against actual historical data simply offers the best hard factual backing available. #Copyright 2001 by WWW robertwcolbycom.

Updates and reprints available from www.robertwcolbycom_ Dunnigan's One-Way Formula Dunnigan'$ One-Way Formula requires a test of a previous bottom followed by an upward thrust for a signal. And it requires a test of a previous top followed by a downward thrust for a sell signal. In addition, the entire range of the thrust must be away from the range of the previous that is, both the high and the low of the thrust day must be above the high of the previous day for a signal, and both the low and the high of the thrust must be below the low of the previous for a sell signal. These strict criteria are designed to give fewer but more significant signals For further discussion, see Dunnigan, W. (1954), Select Studies in Speculation; San Francisco: Dunnigan. Also, see Dunnigan, W. (1956, 1997), New Blueprints for Gains in Stocks and Grains & One-Way Formula for Trading in Stocks and Com- modities, London: Pitman. Dunnigan's Thrust Method Dunnigan'$ Thrust Method is a trend reversal signal that is triggered by any one of five different price setups on any given confirmed the next day by a thrust, which is a relatively move The optimal size of the thrust can be determined by back-testing: set buy day day; buy day day - day; large price Dunnigan's Thrust Method 255 In a downswing, which is defined as lower highs and lower lows, there are five preconditions that set-up a trend reversal buy-signal using daily data: 1. A test of a previous daily bottom. 2_ A closing reversal (a lower daily low followed by a reversal to a higher daily close)  3. A narrow daily range of less than half the largest daily range for the current downswing: 4 An inside with both a lower daily high and a higher daily low than the previous For each of these four preconditions, the signal is given if there is a thrust in an upward direction the very next The fifth precondition is a fail-safe that as- sures us that shall never miss a major trend: an penetration of a previous upswing high sets up an upward trend-change signal. In this fifth case, there is no time limit on confirmation by a thrust the thrust may confirm the fifth setup many days later to complete the signal. In an upswing, which is defined as higher highs and higher there are five preconditions that set-up & reversal sell signal using daily data: 1. Atest of a previous daily high: 2. A closing price reversal a higher daily high followed by a reversal to a lower daily close). 3. A narrow daily range of less than half the largest daily range for the current upswing: 4 An inside with both a lower daily high and a higher daily low than the previous For each of these four preconditions, the sell signal is given if there is a thrust in downward direction the very next day. Again, the fifth precondition is a fail-safe in that it assures us that we shall never miss major trend: downside penetration of a previous downswing low sets up downward trend-change signal. In this fifth case, there is no time limit on confirmation by a thrust--the thrust may confirm the fifth setup many later to complete the sell signal. Repeat signals, especially the test of the previous bottom Or top and the closing price reversal, offer even more significant confirmation. Especially significant are double thrusts, when one thrust is immediately followed by another; O when the thrust is followed by a brief hesitation then another thrust: price day; day: buy day: upside we buy lows; swing day; day: days first 256 Technical Market Indicators Efficient Market Hypothesis The Efficient Market Hypothesis is the opposite of technical analysis It is a toned- down version of the more strongly stated Random Walk Hypothesis. (See Random Walk Hypothesis: ) Basically, the idea is that the market is so efficient that it instantly discounts all known information; which is instantly reflected in stock prices. So, there is nothing anyone can do to beat the markets, since anything knowable will already be reflected in the current price. The Efficient Market Hypothesis has never been proved and appears to be slowly dying out Contradictory research evidence has been accumulating: Moreover; it is impossible to find practical market professionals, traders and investors, willing to even entertain the idea.

He defines Bear Power as the daily low minus this 13-day EMA Bull Power High EMA Bear Power Low EMA Elder's basic trading rules for Elder-Ray are: when the longer-term trend is up and Bear Power is negative but that is, beginning to become less negative. It is also helpful, though not essential, if there is a positive divergence in Bear Power; that is, if price is making lower lows but Bear Power is making higher lows. Liquidate positions on negative divergence in Bull Power: Sell short when the longer-term trend is down and Bull Power is positive but falling, that is, beginning to become less positive. It is also helpful, though not essen- tial, if there is a negative divergence in Bull Power; that is, if price is making higher highs but Bull Power is making lower highs. If Bull Power is already negative, it is too late to initiate short positions Cover short positions on a positive divergence in Bear Power: Using price price Buy rising; long Envelopes, Moving Average Envelopes, and Trading Bands 257 End Point Moving Average (EPMA) This term is a misnomer; strictly speaking, because the actual indicator is not com- like a moving average. Rather, EPMA is the ending value of a Linear Regres- sion trendline plus its slope. (See Time Series Forecast (TSF) ) Envelopes, Moving Average Envelopes, and Trading Bands Envelopes are plotted fixed percentage above and below moving average. En- velopes are commonly used for overbought and oversold signals: a sell signal is gen- erated when the security reaches the upper band; and a signal is generated at the lower band. The length of the moving average and the appropriate percentage plus and minus shift of the moving average both depend on the trading characteristics and the volatility of the security In general, a greater volatility results in a larger percent- age shift: When overzealous buyers and sellers push to extremes, the upper and lower bands provide resistance and support levels for to reverse trend and revert to the mean (the moving average) O even the opposite extreme_ The parameters for Envelopes can vary widely according to a security'$ indi- vidual observed historical habits and volatility. For example, Jerry Favors, well- known market newsletter writer; calculates 21-day exponential moving average (EMA) for the general stock market indexes, such as the Dow-Jones Industrial Aver- age. For a vertical shift percentage, Jerry favors plus and minus 3.59. That is, he adds 3.59 to each point on this 21-day EMA to derive the upper envelope. Then he sub- tracts 3.59 from each on this 21-day EMA to plot the envelope. Indicator Strategy Example for Envelopes Even naive testing assumptions suggest that Envelopes have potential value as purely mechanical, contra-trend technical indicator: The great majority of oversold buy signals would have been profitable. Moreover; these signals would have been robust, with all exponential moving average lengths from 1 to 50 minus and plus two percent; profitable and right most of the time, for long trades only: As attractive as high percentage of profitable trades may seem; however; it is important to note that this (like other contra-trend strategies) failed to provide any protection in the Crash of '87, the decline of 1998 and other market price drops. As the chart shows, there are sharp equity drawdowns. Using Envelopes for contra-trend oversold and overbought signals slightly outperformed the passive buy-and-hold strategy for long trades only, while short selling would not have been profitable in the past: puted buy prices price point lower buy days, 8 Envelope Ref-1 opt1 EMA +~% goodl Equity (1,181) 4 10Q0' 500 Cumulative Equity Line for Longs Only Semi-Log Scale 1500 1000 Signals for Envelopes; 4-day EMA, at Sell at +2% S&P 500 Futures Contract (CSI Perpetual) Daily Price Close Semi-Log Scale 500 1982 {983 1984 i1985 11g86' {1987 11g88 '1989 1990' Hg91' 11992 1993 1igg4' I1995 19g6 1997 1998 '1999 pooo 7Y Buy 22%, Envelopes, Four EMA & Two-Percent Total net profit 1080.61 Open position value NJA Net Profit/Buy&Hold 3.35 Percent gain/loss 1080.61 Annual percent gain/loss 57.94 Annual Net %/B&H 3.35 Initial investment 100 Interest earned Current position Out Date position entered 12/5/00 #of days per trade 35.26 BuylHold profit 1045.54 Days in test 6807 Buy/Hold pct gain/loss 1045.54 Annual BIH pct gainlloss 56.06 Total closed trades 88 Commissions paid Avg profit per trade 12.28 Win/Avg Loss ratio 1.31 Total long trades 88 Total short trades Long Win Trade % 84.09 Winning long trades 74 Winning short trades Short Win Trade % #DIVIO!

In a exploratory data analysis process, many variables are taken into account and compared, a variety of techniques, in a search for sys- tematic patterns. We require variables found to be related to pass tests of logic and common sense before we proceed to the next step in model building: Exponential Moving Average (EMA); Exponential Smoothing The Exponential Moving Average (EMA is also referred to as Exponential Smooth- The EMA is the best of the moving average techniques, and it is increasingly pre- ferred by technical analysts over other moving average methods. Behaviorally, in its responsiveness to new data generated by the markets, the EMA represents an excellent compromise between the overly sensitive weighted moving average and the overly sluggish simple moving average. Compared to other averaging techniques, the EMA follows the trend of the current data smoothly and seamlessly, minimizing jumps, wiggles, and Computationally, the EMA is the simplest and most streamlined of all moving average techniques. The EMA requires the fewest calculations, the least data han - and the least data history: The EMA requires numerical values for only two data periods: the most recently available raw data and the immediate past period's EMA For example, working with daily data, we need only today'$ observed, unprocessed data and yesterday'$ EMA in order to calculate today's EMA. Thus; the EMA elimi- nates the need to keep and handle lists of historical data: A significant advantage of this superior computational method is that the EMA is never distorted by old data suddenly dropping out of the calculation. Old data is never suddenly dropped because it is not actually of the calculation. For cal purposes, the effect of past data fades away gradually due to the ever decreasing weighting of yesterday'$ EMA. The EMAs method of calculation correctly avoids the problem of erratic current movement caused solely by irrelevant and obsolete data dropping out of the calculation. typical using ing; being lags. dling, long practi- part 262 Technical Market Indicators An Exponential Moving Average is calculated as follows: EMA = (C Ep)K + Ep where EMA the Exponential Moving Average for the current period C = the closing for the current Ep = the Exponential Moving Average for the previous period. K = the exponential smoothing constant; equal to 2/(n + 1). = the total number of periods in a simple moving average to be roughly approximated by the EMA The exponential smoothing constant formula, K = 2/(n + 1) allows an approx- imate comparison of any EMA to the more sluggish Simple Moving Average of length n. As the number of n increases, the value of K grows ever smaller; and the EMA becomes increasingly less sensitive to the newer data. Use this table to quickly convert from simple n days to exponential smoothing constants (K), and back: K = 2/(n + 1) K = 2/(n + 1) days K = Z/n + 1) n days K = Z/(n + 1) 1.00000 10 0.18182 100 0.01980 1000 0.00200 2 0.66667 20 0.09524 200 0.00995 2000 0.00100 3 0.50000 30 0.06452 300 0.00664 3000 0.00067 0.40000 40 0.04878 400 0.00499 4000 0.00050 5 0.33333 50 0.03922 500 0.00399 5000 0.00040 6 0.28571 60 0.03279 600 0.00333 6000 0.00033 0.25000 70 0.02817 700 0.00285 7000 0.00029 8 0.22222 80 0.02469 800 0.00250 8000 0.00025 9 0.20000 90 0.02198 900 0.00222 9000 0.00022 10 0.18182 100 0.01980 1000 0.00200 10000 0.00020 When first starting a new EMA, it takes approximately n days of calculations for an accurate reading: For a quick startup of a EMA, o the first day of calculation we may use a n day simple moving average to approximate the previous day' $ EMA (Ep) in the formula; EMA = (C - Ep)K + Ep After that first we will never need any data other than yesterday' $ EMA and today' $ fresh data to maintain our EMA: The table on the facing page illustrates how to compute an EMA of four ods, which is also known as 40% EMA, named for the exponential smoothing con- stant; K period. price days days days day;` peri- Example of Exponential Smoothing Approximating a 4-Period Simple Moving Average Smoothing Difference Difference Constant (K) Times Add Previous Close Minus Equals Smoothing Previous Current NYSE Periods EMA Previous Multiply 2: (n + 1) Constant Period's New Year End Close EMA (D) 2+ (4 + 1) Dx K EMA EMA 1968 58.90 58.90 0.00 0.00 58.90 58.90 1969 51.53 58.90 ~7.37 -2.95 +58.90 55.95 1970 50.23 55.95 5.72 -2.95 +55.95 53.66 1971 56.43 53.66 +2.77 +1.11 +53.66 54.77 1972 64.48 54.77 +9.71 +3.88 +54.77 58.65 1973 51.82 58.65 6.83 -2.73 +58.65 55.92 1974 36.13 55.92 19.79 -7.92 +55.92 48.00 1 1975 47.64 48.00 0.36 -0.14 +48.00 47.86 1976 57.88 47.86 +10.02 L +4.01 +47.86 51.87 1977 52.50 51.87 +0.63 +0.25 +51.87 52.12 3 1979 63.88 52.72 +9.53 1 +8.69 +52.72 58.42 1980 77.86 56.41 +21.45 +8.58 +56.41 64.99 1 1981 71.11 64.99 +6.12 +2.45 +64.99 67.44 1982 81.03 67.44 +13.59 +5.44 +67.44 72.88 2 1983 95.18 72.88 +22.30 +8.92 +72.88 81.80 1984 96.38 81.80 +14.58 4 +5.83 +81.80 87.63 1985 121.58 87.63 +33.95 +13.58 +87.63 101.21 1 1986 138.58 101.21 +37.37 4 +14.95 +101.21 116.16 1987 116.16 +116.16 ] 8 by 264 Technical Market Indicators Indicator Strategy Example for the Exponential Moving Average (EMA), 120-days Based on the daily closing for the DJIA from 1900 to 2001, Exponential Mov- ing Average Crossover Strategies of all lengths from 1 to 300 days would have been profitable and would have beaten the passive buy-and-hold-strategy by at least 69%.

He reportedly found it while studying the Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt, which is said to be based on these numbers and ratios. It is believed that the sequence was well known to the Egyptians and to Pythagoras before their rediscovery by Leonardo. Fibonacci numbers are a sequence where successive number is the sum of the two previous numbers: 0, 1,1,2,3,5,8, 13,21,34,55, 89, 144,233,377, 610,987, and so forth: These numbers possess intriguing interrelationships. It is an eye-opening exer- cise to play with them in a spread sheet (see table) First, number down each row in column A to make a reference label. Second, we create the Fibonacci sequence in column B, starting with zero in cell Bl and one in cell B2, then add each cell's value to the previous cell's value. Third, in column C, divide each number in the Fibonacci sequence in column B by the previous number in the Fibonacci sequence, immedi- ately above in column B. Fourth, in column D, divide each number in the Fibonacci sequence by the number two cells up. Fifth, in column E, divide each number in the Fibonacci sequence by the number three cells up. This is the Fibonacci expansion se- quence, where subsequent numbers are 1.618 times the previous number; are 2.618 times the next previous number; and are 4.236 times the number three cells up. The next three columns (F; G, H) show the Fibonacci contraction sequence, where the ratio of the current Fibonacci number t0 the next one is 0.618 times, then the ratio to the one after that is 0.382 times, and the ratio to the number three cells down is 0.236 times. In addition you will find 0.5000, 1.000, and 2.000 in the table, and these are also useful. Finally, please note that the square roots of the ratios of 0.618 and 1.618 are 0.786 and 1.272. When projecting targets forward, in ascending order; the most important Fibonacci ratios are: 0.236, 0.382, 0.500, 0.618, 0.786, 1.000, 1.272, 1.618, 2.000, 2.618, and 4.236. These ratios are useful in comparing market movements to one another: In technical analysis, the interpretation of Fibonacci numbers is based on expe- rienced judgement: Popular computer software, such as MetaStock@ offers visual studies based on the Fibonacci sequence.

These bisect a straight line connecting an early low to a subsequent high at points on that line that are 61.89, S09, and 38.29 of the length of the line. Anchor a compass at the subsequent high, then draw a circle through these points. When future move meets a curving Arc and Circle line extended out to the right of the chart; look for support, resistance and/or trend change. Simi- larly, Arcs and Circles also are drawn through a Fibonacci proportioned straight line from an early high to subsequent low: Fibonacci Fans also offer support and resistance. Fans are computed and drawn on a chart in five steps: 1. Subtract an early significant low price from a subsequent significant high price. 2 Multiply that difference by 61.8%, 50%, and 38.29. 3. Add these products to the early low price. point_ price 272 Technical Market Indicators 4 Plot those points (from 3) directly beneath and on the same date as the subsequent high price. 5. Connect the early low price to the plotted points (from 4) with straight lines extending forward in time. The resulting ascending Fibonacci Fans are estimates of future support and re- sistance. A similar method is used to plot descending Fibonacci Fans, based on the distance from a significant high to a subsequent significant low; and with the Fibonacci price plotted directly above the subsequent low. Fibonacci Retracements also are based on line that the user may draw con- necting significant troughs and peaks. If that line is the retracement lines will project downward; if that line is falling, the retracement lines will project up- ward. These Retracement lines offer support and resistance. Note on the graph of the NASDAQ 100 futures contract that the 0.618 retracement ratio based on the steep 2-month price decline from 3/24/00 to 5/24/00 worked well as resistance to rallies on 7/17/00 and 9/1/00. The 0.236 retracement ratio was effective support on 8/3/00. The Fibonacci Pentagon/Star can be overlaid on top of a price chart, such that one of the sides of either the pentagon or the star connects by a straight line a signif- icant price bottom and a significant price top. Then the other lines that make up the Pentagon/Star can be used to anticipate potential levels of support and resistance be- fore might appear in actual price data. The Pentagon/Star begins with a regular pentagon. To reveal the five-pointed star within the pentagon, draw five straight di- agonal lines through the body of the pentagon from each corner to the second next corner (that is, skipping over the adjacent corners). Each line in the star has a length that is 1.618 times the length of each side of the pentagon: Fibonacci Time Zones are vertical lines placed at time intervals separated by Fibonacci numbers Starting with an obvious turning high or low; labeled day zero, MetaStock@ will count and mark the subsequent trading days (skipping week- ends and holidays) according to the Fibonacci sequence: 0,1,1,2,3,5,8, 13,21,34, 55, 89, 144, 233,377,610, 987, and s0 forth: Be alert for possible directional trend changes at or near these vertical lines marking the Fibonacci Time Zones Robert C. Miner* proportions future time by Fibonacci ratios. First, Miner applies Fibonacci Time-Cycle Ratios to the time duration of the latest completed using both trading and calendar days. The most important Fibonacci ratios are: 0.382, 0.500, 0.618, 1.000, 1.618,.2.000, and 2.618. Miner's Alternative Time Projections are calculated as time ratios of the pre- vious price swing in the same direction: up swings are measured out as proportions of previous up swings, while down swings are measured out as proportions of previous down swings. Alternative Time Projections may also be derived from same-direction swings earlier than the latest one.

Fibonacci ratios of that initial vibration time projected forward co- incide with subsequent turning dates, including the end of the completed trend (page 5-38)* Of secondary importance are the counts, numbering each day in straight nu- merical sequence from outstanding turning points, using both trading days and calen- dar days. When one or more day counts is a number in the Fibonacci sequence, the probability of a directional trend change is heightened. The more hits on Fibonacci numbers, the greater the confirmation and power of that date. As suggested by W D. Gann; Miner also uses multiples of 30 (specifically, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180,210, 240, 270, 300, 330, and 360), and multiples of 36 (specif- ically, 36, 72, 108, 144, 180, 216, 252, 288, 324, and 360) in his counts. An- niversary dates of previous turning in history also add value to his analysis of time Miner also uses Bollinger Bands (which are also known as Standard Deviation Bands and Volatility Bands to help identify and confirm timelprice turning points. standard deviations above and below a moving average create a channel that en- closes 959 of the price action: In relatively low volatility, sideways trading-range markets, such bands reliably indicate support and resistance. In trending markets, where the trend is strong and continuing, reactions against the trend often do not ex- ceed the moving average mid-way between the upper and lower bands. In a bullish trend, spends more of the time testing the upper band and the moving average. In a bearish trend, spends more of the time testing the lower band and the mov- ing average.

The Force Index is calculated precisely the same way as older indicator see Vol- ume Price Momentum Oscillator (V*PMO)) Elder offers five pages covering a number of rather complex interpretations of what he re-names the Force Index. Basically he fades a very short-term version when it is contrary to the larger trend, and he looks for divergences of the Force Index ver- sus the underlying series. As purely mechanical indicator; however; our tests suggest that the Force Index is better used as trend-following indicator than faded as contra-trend indicator: Fourier Analysis: Fast Fourier Transform Fourier Analysis is said to be ideally suited for finding precise recurring cycles in the physical sciences. Thus it is tempting for well-educated analysts with strong mathe- matical backgrounds to apply this method to market data: The problem is that unlike data from the physical sciences, market data is relatively irregular: The market is not pendulum: Although we are able to obtain precise and seemingly scientific answers using Fourier Analysis, we cannot rely on the underlying assumptions and, therefore, we can have no confidence about any value in forecasting: In fact, our research sug- gests that it is not fruitful to apply Fourier Analysis to cyclical analysis of financial markets_ In the words of Richard and Jack Schwager (Schwager on Futures, Technical Analysis, John Wiley, New York; 1996, 775 pages, pages 591-2), cy- cles are only one market force and can at times be swamped by other market influ- ences Moreover; even the most consistent will deviate from their mathematical representations Therefore, the rigid application of cycle projections in making trading decisions (to the exclusion of other methods and considerations) is a recipe for disaster much price Mogey cycles 276 Technical Market Indicators Fourier transform (FT) is a frequency description of time domain events. FT is designed to study repetitious phenomena: FT is named for French analyst and physi- cist, Jean Baptiste Joseph Fourier (1768-1830), whose study of the conduction of heat had a profound influence on mathematical physics and on the study of real func- tions. In 1822, Fourier was the first to represent any function as an infinite summation of sine and cosine terms. FT decomposes or separates a waveform Or function into si- nusoids of different frequency which sum to the original waveform. It identifies o distinguishes the different frequency sinusoids and their respective amplitudes FT is an integral transform that sends function f to another function F Under reasonable conditions the FT is invertible. The Fourier transform of f(x) can be expressed as follows: Fly) = J__fkx) exp(-iyx) dx where the symbol for the exponential function the symbol for the imaginary number the square root of _ 1 dx denotes an element, the derivative of x Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is an efficient algorithm for digital computation of the Fourier transform. FFT is an abbreviated calculation that computes quickly, in seconds rather than minutes. The FFT sacrifices phase relationships and concentrates only on length and amplitude (strength). The benefit of FFT is its ability to ex- tract the predominate cycle from a series of data, such as a security FFTs are based on the principal that any finite, time-ordered set of data can be approximated by decomposing the data into a set of sine waves. Each sine wave has specific length, amplitude, and phase relationship to the other sine waves. Be- cause FFTs were designed to be applied to non-trending, periodic data and security data tends to be trending, the raw data must be detrended, commonly by a linear regression trendline. Also, security data is not truly periodic, since securities are not traded on weekends and some holidays These discontinuities must be removed by passing the data through a smoothing function, such as Hamming window, which is based on binary codes that correct transmission errors 0n the pre- sumption that the chance of a very high proportion of errors is negligible. exp cycle price. cycle price price using price Fourier Analysis: Fast Fourier Transform 277 Equis MetaStock software program can extract the predominate FFT from price data and display cycle length and amplitude (cycle strength). the fol- lowing "default" FFT formula into the MetaStock  Indicator Builder: fft(CLOSE, 100, 1, DETREND, POWER) where fft Fast Fourier Transform CLOSE the closing price of the 100 the PERIOD of time to analyze, in days DETREND = the linear regression smoothing method used to remove trends from the data POWER the type of analysis display, the power spectrum, which is a plot in histogram form of the power (y-axis> versus length or frequency (x-axis). Cycle power (the y-axis) of a Fourier power spectrum is the amplitude squared. This FFT formula plots a graph, and the highest peak on that graphed line, as measured against the vertical y-axis, is the "typical" dominant cycle length. Rather than interpreting this time length as a precise number of experience sug- gests that it might be more practical to think of it as "plus or minus a few days' be- cause of the typical variability of cycles as observed in markets. On his website (WWWmesasoftware.com) John F Ehlers, professional engineer and market cycles researcher; points out that the correct use f Fourier Transforms re- quires relatively long databases, and the data must be stationary (non-shifting) over the observation period. For short databases, he has concluded that "the use of FFTs for trading is not advisable. Ehlers designed his Maximum Entropy Spectral Analy- sis (MESA) software program to be a better solution than FFTs for identifying short; shifting on relatively small quantities of data Loading the Dow-Jones Industrial Average daily closing for the past 100 from 1900 to 2000 and employing the Equis MetaStock@ formula fft(CLOSE, 100, 1, DETREND, POWER), the FFT dominant length for the daily DJIA for the past century is about 22.57 on average, give or take a few In Column 3 of the table, ran FFT on the actual daily closing of the DJIA_ We relied on the FFT formula to de-trend this data: In Column 4 we first detrended the actual DJIA by dividing the daily close by 170-day exponential moving average of the close, then we tested that ratio. (See our section on Exponential Moving Average. The FFT formula, using a linear regression trendline, detrended that close/EMA ratio. Therefore, we could say the raw closing price data was twice detrended. As expected from reading the literature, the second, twice de-trended method resulted in somewhat less variability and greater stability of the length: cycle Copy - day cycle cycle cycle cycle days; long cycles prices years cycle days days: price we cycle 3 #FOURIER (0,1026) 22 22 21 21 20 20 19 19 18 18 17 17 16 16 15 15 14 14 13 13 12 12 11 11 10 10 10 12 13 15 1900 Fourier Analysis: Fast Fourier Transform 279 The table shows how the FFT cycle length at various start dates has shifted over the past 70 years_ We arbitrarily broke the database into 14 overlapping test windows.

After we tested the longest window, starting on 1/2/30, we then shifted forward in time in 5-year time increments in an effort to mea- sure how shifts in the starting date would impact the calculated FFT dominant length.

(See John F Ehlers, "Creating Indicators With Physics" Technical Analysis of Stocks & Commodities V: 11.10 (pages 395-400) , www.traders.com.) On previous occasions, Ehlers found 9-day, 14 and 22-day dominant lengths for the S&P 500 futures, which were within the historical FFT ranges we found in the table above.

Ehlers found the S&P to be the best futures contract in terms of its statistical cyclic behavior; followed by U.S. Trea- sury Bonds (with a dominant cycle of 9 days) Of 12 contracts examined, all showed dominant cycles within a range of 7 to 19 Funds Net Purchases Index The Funds Net Purchases Index is a sentiment indicator developed by Arthur A Mer- rill, CMT Merrill found that professionally managed mutual fund net buy-sell activ- ity was highly significant indicator of future stock market direction over forward periods of 13,26,and 52 weeks Data on mutual fund purchases and sales of common stocks and o total fund assets for stock; bond and income funds is published by Barron $ financial weekly newspaper on monthly basis, with about a 1-month More timely data is avail- able on a subscription basis from the Investment Company Institute, 1600 M Street NW, Washington, DC 20036. To compute Merrill's indicator; first subtract sales of common stock from pur- chases of common stock. Second, divide that difference by total fund assets, includ- stock; bond and income funds. Third, smooth that ratio with a 33% exponential smoothing constant; which is roughly the equivalent of a S-month simple moving average _ Fourth, normalize  the smoothed ratio by dividing it by the  standard deviation. Over a 10-year back-test period, Merrill found that his Funds Net Purchases Index was bullish when it was greater than two thirds of one standard deviation above the mean. It was bearish when more than two thirds of one standard deviation below the mean: Forward predictions were highly significant statistically, measured against the Dow-Jones Industrial Average over three different time intervals, 13, 26, and 52 weeks, into the future_ Futures Algorithm of Rollovers for CSI's Perpetual Contracte CSIs Perpetual Contract@ data is computed by a proprietary CSI formula that makes historical futures data useful for long-term technical analysis studies. Historical data needs to be adjusted because of price gaps between contracts with different expiration dates. CSI Perpetual Contract is a time-weighted average price of the two nearest ac- tive contracts. As the nearest contract approaches expiration, it is allocated progres- sively less weight; according to a straight linear formula reflecting the number of days remaining until expiration (OT roll date). Meanwhile, the next contract forward in time days. lag: ing Futures Algorithm of Rollovers for CSIs Perpetual Contracte 281 is allocated progressively greater weight each day. Add the two time-weighted con- tract values each day to arrive at the CSI Perpetual Contract. The CSI Perpetual Contract is actually simpler than it may seem at first glance, as illustrated by the following practical example. For the Standard & Poor s 500 Stock Composite Index Futures Contracts, there are three months between contracts. Three months is about 63 trading days on average, depending on the distribution of holidays and other minor quirks of the calendar: There are four contracts each calen- dar year;, one expiring each quarter 0 the third Friday of March, June, September; and December: Assume it is the second Thursday of June. The nearest contract; the June con- tact, will expire a week from tomorrow, on Friday one week and one from to- This Thursday is the traditionally predetermined roll date, when the pit-trader members of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange name the next contract (in this case the September contract) the front month: Therefore, as of the real estate on the trading floor is now reserved for trading the September contract. According to the CSI Perpetual Contract formula, on this Thursday roll date, the nearest contract; the soon-expiring June contract; is weighted at 0/63 times the June contract price (and zero divided by sixty three equals zero). Meanwhile, the new "front-month Septem - ber contract is weighted 63/63 times the September contract (that is, 100% of the September contract price). The next trading day, Friday, the September contract is weighted 62/63 times the September contract price and the December contract is weighted 1/63 times the De- cember contract price. The third trading Monday; the September contract is weighted 61/63 times the September contract and the December is weighted 2/63 times the December contract The fourth trading Tuesday; the tember is weighted 60/63 times the September and the December is weighted 3/63 times the December And so on, until at the September contract roll date (on the second Thursday of September) , the September contract is weighted 0/63 times the September contract and the December contract is weighted 63/63 times the December contract The next December is weighted 62/63 and the March is weighted 1/63 times the March price. The second the December contract is weighted 61/63 and the March is weighted 2/63 times the March price. Add the two weighted contracts to arrive at the CSI Perpetual Contract. An alternative is to weight the nearest two contracts by their respective open in- terests, rolling forward and excluding the nearest contract when heaviest open inter- est shifts to the subsequent delivery month: For long-term computer studies in technical analysis, this CSI Perpetual Con- tract is probably the best solution for handling rollovers of contracts The only disad- vantage of CSI Perpetual Contract is that we cannot actually or sell it or use it for precise support and resistance levels for short-term trading: day day: today; prime price day; price price. day; Sep- price price. price price. day day; buy 282 Technical Market Indicators An alternate method is backward-adjusted contracts. Here, at the roll date, if the next contract is trading, say, 10 points above the expiring June contract; then add 10 points to all historical data. On the other hand, if the next contract is trading 10 points below the expiring June contract, then subtract 10 points from all historical data to fill the gap: Unfortunately, this method can produce negative prices way back in time, and such negative numbers can cause problems in back testing of technical strategies. Also, long-term chart trend analysis may be substantially distorted. So, CSI invented their Perpetual Contract to eliminate historical negative num- bers. And the long-term charts look right But; of course, you cannot call your broker and actually place an order for a CSI Perpetual Contract, since do not trade. Futures Contracts: Expiration Months and Symbols Futures contracts generally become most actively traded a few months before expire. Trading activity dries Up, however; in the month of expiration O in some cases the month before expiration, depending o the traditions of the particular contract: Futures traders must pay attention to the calendar and to shifts in volume and open in- terest. It generally pays to trade only in the most active contracts in order to avoid get- caught by a lack of liquidity which increases slippage. (Slippage is the difference between the price you expect to get on your order and the price you actually get:) Stock index options expire on the Saturday following the third Friday of each month. Those third Fridays in March, June, September; and December are referred to as "triple witching, because futures, index options and individual stock options all expire. The before and after such simultaneous expirations have been unusually volatile. Generally, it is better to exit expiring well before expiration, since the time premiums and liquidity erode in an accelerating fashion in the days and weeks before expiration: Symbol Month January February March April June 1 Gaerer November December they they ting days options May July Gann Angles 283 Gann Angles* W. D. Gann (1878-1955) developed the use of what he called "Geometric Angles; now commonly referred to as Gann Angles, used to determine trend direction and strength, support and resistance, as well as probabilities of price reversal: Gann was fascinated by the relation of time (T) and price (P). Gann drew his an- gles from all significant price pivot point highs and lows He used just one pivot point to draw an angle that rose (or fell) at predetermined and fixed rates of speed, as follows: TxP degrees 1 X 8 82.5 degrees 1 X 4 75 degrees 1 X 3 71.25 degrees 1 X 2 63.75 degrees 1 X 45 degrees 2 X 26.25 degrees 3 X 1 18.75 degrees 4 X 15 degrees 8 X 1 7.5 degrees where T the number of units of time, graphically plotted on the horizontal x-axis_ P = the number of units of price, graphically plotted on the vertical y-axis. read as by degrees specifies the of the Gann measured in degrees. Translating time by into degrees assumes square grid, where one unit of time on the x-axis takes up the same amount of horizontal space as the one unit of on the y-axis takes up vertical space. For example, 1/16 of an inch might be set to one week of time on the horizontal x-axis, and 1/16 of an inch might be set to one dollar of on the vertical y-axis. On such a proportionally scaled chart; the 1 X 1 geometric angle, which for every one unit of time rises one in price, is a 45 de- gree angle. Without this equality of time and price scaling, Gann angles stated in degrees do not work out correctly.

Gann often said that the weekly chart was more important than the daily chart. Nevertheless, Gann angles are flexible and can be used on any time-scale, So long as the time by price proportions are correctly calculated. Gann angles offer indications of support and resistance that may not be evident based on any other method. For example, during an up-trend, the 1 X 1 angle tends to provide major support: A major reversal is signaled when fall below the 1 X 1 angle. According to Gann, should then be expected to fall to the next an- gle below_-the 2 X 1 angle. In other words, as one angle is penetrated, expect to test the next which is less steep. Gann placed special emphasis on the 1 X 1 angle. On a perfectly proportioned time by price in an uptrend, the 1 X 1 angle extends "northeast" from a price pivot low at a precise 45 degree angle. This 1 X 1 angle is the most significant angle: it represents a sustainable, perfectly balanced trend, not too fast and not too slow, but just right: In a bullish uptrend, the 1 X 1 angle tends to provide major sup- port. When this 1 X 1 angle is broken, & significant price trend reversal is signaled. The price should then drop down to test the 2 X 1 angle. In a downtrend, the 1 X 1 angle extends southeast" from a price pivot point high at a precise 45 degree angle. Eventually after a downtrend, when moves above and stays above the 1 X 1 angle (which is sloping down and to the left at 45 de- grees) , should then make its way up to test the next; less-steep Gann angle -the declining 2 1 angle. An angle that provided resistance, once decisively broken, should provide support Furthermore, when a 1 angle crosses horizontal line extending forward in time from a significant past pivot (an obvious high or low), then time and are square relative to that past pivot point; and that is a likely time for a change in trend or an acceleration of the existing trend. Also, when a geometric angle crosses zero Or another geometric angle, a trend change is likely. Identification of the most important Gann angle is dependent of the price level of the instrument analyzed: very high and very low priced instruments will follow steeper and shallower Gann angles, respectively: In other words, the best functioning Gann angle for support and resistance depends on the price level of the instrument be- analyzed. For the S&P 500 Composite Stock Price Index, a relevant support and resistance price channel was well defined by 2 X weekly Gann angles from the 8/9/82 price low at 102.20 until 1995.After the 12/9/94 low at 442.88,the S&Pprice level quickly rose So high that the bull market trend was better defined by the 1 X 4 weekly prices prices prices angle, grid, point price price point price price ing rising 1550 1500' 1450 1400 1350 1300 1250 1200 S & P 500 Composite Index 1150 with parallel Weekly Gann Angles 1100 Arithmetic-Scale Bar Chart 14 10501 Weekly 1000 Gann Angles 950 900 850 800 750 700 650 600 550 450 400 2 1 350 Weekly 300 Gann Angles 250 200 150 100 Up from Zero 50 M: Ti| 6 JTIT 'lis8o {1981 11982 {1983 01984 i1985 '1986 '1987 {1988 '1989 '[4ggo {199 41992 1igg3' Figga" '1995 {1996 11997 T4og8" 7lg9g p2ooo 8 500 8 75 Cisco Systems (CSCO) Weekly Bars 70 Weekly 2 X Gann Angles, drawn from any high or Iow; 65 and rising at the rate of one point every two weeks, would have been useful for identifying support and resistance: When the last Gann Angle broke, 35 in September 2000 price fell quickly: 30 25 20 15 10 500O00 4llV Lullutluutulutnkly LHL Iyuitsto-kLB  zodbu] Hiaskeyubb '1997 M A MM A Is lo IN D '1998 MA M J V_AJS b N DD li9o9 _MIA M AS k NN D 2000_M_ AAM N' D 2001 #rynh Ill Lyyelhll Gann's Square of Nine 287 Gann angles. A glance at the chart should make obvious the value of these Gann an- gles, which can be drawn before the fact, as soon as the user can identify a pivot point high or low. Gann also divided significant and time ranges and previous highs and lows into eighths, and looked for support and resistance there. example, dividing the low to high range after a substantial upswing, the most important divisions would be 8/8 (or the high), 1/2 (the midpoint) , and 0/8 (the low). Next most important would be 3/8 and 5/8. Expressed in decimals, 3/8 is 0.375 and 5/8 is 0.625, which are only .007 away from the Fibonacci ratios of 0.382 and 0.618. Gann's Square of Nine WD. Gann's Square of Nine number has been related to a number of natural cy- cles, relationships and structures, including those that appear in the structure of the Great Pyramid, Fibonacci spirals, various harmonic frequencies, the celestial and acoustic vibrations of Pythagoras, Galileo's Theorem of Equivalence and his concep- tion of solar motion, and the equal tempered twelve-tone musical scale of Leonard Euler; as pointed out by Constance Brown, CMT; CPO, of Aerodynamic In- vestments Inc. on her web site, www aeroinvest.com_ The illustration here, based on the work of Gann expert Peter Suarez, has been corrected for errors that appear in popular published sources The best way to learn about it is to study it in detail. From one at the center; it expands in a linear progres- sion, spiraling around and outward in a clockwise fashion. One of the interesting things to note are the squares of the even numbers ascending on diagonal to the northeast (parallel to the 45 degree angle) and squares of the odd numbers descend- on a diagonal to the southwest (parallel to the 225 degree angle). The degrees of a 360 degree full circle are marked in a counter-clockwise fash- ion, with major emphasis on the horizontal, vertical and diagonal angles, specifically 45,90, 135, 180, 225,.270, 315, and 360 degrees When a significant high or low appears in tradable instrument of interest; we look to the next numbers these major angles for potential support, resistance and price targets. For example, when the S&P 500 Stock Index futures contract set its all-time low at 101 on 8/9/82 and reversed upward, we might have looked to numbers on the ma- jor angles up from 45 degrees (on which that 101 low lies) for upside targets, ically 106, 111, 116, 122, 127, 133, 139, 145 (which is a full number cycle of 360 degrees at this price level), and so on, upward and outward around the spiral. As increases, the numerical distance between angles grows larger: Trial and error experimentation is the only way to learn this method.

Indeed, GM used to be one of the largest and most powerful corporations in America, and GM stock was a speculative favorite on Wall Street: The movements of GM stock were closely followed as a bellwether (leading indicator) of the dominant forces of demand (bullish) and supply (bearish) for the stock market in general. The General Motors Bellwether rule is defined by the failure of the existing trend of GM stock to continue in the same direction. A signal is recognized when the prevailing trend stalls out for four consecutive months. On the bullish side, fol- lowing general market decline, buy when GM stock fails to reach a new low within 4-month time period. On the bearish side, following a general market sell when GM stock fails to reach a new high for four consecutive months This simple rule worked like a charm from 1929 to 1958: of ten signals, ten were profitable: A losing signal in 1959 was followed by three more ones in 1961-2. Sadly, the General Motors Bellwether went haywire from 1962 to 1976, batting only 50/50 while underperforming the naive buy-and-hold strategy, according to Norman Fosback, Stock Market Logic, The Institute for Econometric Research, 3471 North Federal Highway, Fort Lauderdale, FL 33306, 1976, 384 pages. Data gathered by Thomas A. Meyers and published in the edition of this book indicated that in the ten years from April 1974 to 1984, the General Motors Bellwether produced six winning signals and nine signals, and it actually would have lost money: The price chart shows that GM has not pace with the market over the past twenty years. Its as a market leader ended a long time ago_ Indicator Strategy Example for General Motors as a Bellwether Based on 20-year file of daily data for the closing of GM and the DJIA from March 17, 1980, to November 22, 2000, a systematic search failed to uncover any strategy that beat the market: Short selling would have lost heavily and consistently. However; for trades only, GM crossovers of various length exponential moving averages would have produced slightly profitable results on purely mechanical sig- nal basis with no subjectivity, no sophisticated technical analysis, and no judgement: Enter (Buy) at the current daily close of the DJIA when the closing price of GM stock today is greater than its own previous day' $ 2- exponential moving average. good price rise, good first May losing kept days price long Long price day 8 700: V> EMA (1 TO 40) TREND FOLLOWING Equity (647.7) 700 600 600 500 500 400 400 300 300 GM Crossing EMA 2 200 Cumulative Equity Line for Longs Only 200 Semi-Log Scale 100 100 50000 50000 GM 1000 Daily Price Close Semi-Log Scale Dow-Jones Industrial Average Daily Price Close Semi-Log Scale TTT" '1980 i1981 11982 [1983 11984" "1ig85 11986 11987 "1988 {1989 '1990 11991 11992 it993 {i994 '69g5 T1gg6 1997 11998 11999 p2o00 General Motors Bellwether Total net profit 547.68 Open position value NJA Net Profit/Buy&Hold 55.05 Percent gain/loss 547.68 Annual percent gain/loss 26.46 Annual Net %/B&H 55.05 Initial investment 100 Interest earned Current position Out Date position entered 11/16/00 Buy/Hold profit 1218.54 Days in test 7556 # of per trade 7.58 Buy/Hold pct gain/loss 1218.54 Annual BIH pct gainlloss 58.86 Total closed trades 997 Commissions paid Avg profit per trade 0.55 Win/Avg Loss ratio 1.29 Total long trades 997 Total short trades Long Win Trade % 51.45 Winning long trades 513 Winning short trades Short Win Trade % #DIV/O!

The Profit/Loss Index is a complex calculation that relates the Amount of Winning Trades to the Amount of Losing Trades on a scale of 100 (worst possible performance) to 100 (best possible performance) , with zero representing profits equal to losses.

Box 2144, Pompano Beach, FL 33061). It is also known as the Professional Investor $ Trinity Index. The Gross Trinity Index may be calculated and interpreted in five steps. First, calculate the three basic com- ponent ratios that make up the index: Specialist Short Ratio Specialist Shorts/Total Shorts Member Short Ratio = Member Shorts/Total Shorts Public Short Ratio Public Shorts/Total Shorts Each of these short sales ratios are explained separately herein. Buy 4.7 pub- 294 Technical Market Indicators Second, smooth each of these three component ratios using the following expo- nential smoothing constants (for calculation examples, see exponential moving aver- ages): an 189 smoothing constant (roughly equivalent to a 10-week simple moving Average) to both the Specialist Short Ratio and the Public Short Ratio; and a 299 exponential smoothing constant (roughly equivalent to a 6-week simple moving average) applied to the Member Short Ratio. Third, add the smoothed Specialist and Member Short Ratios. Fourth; divide that sum by the smoothed Public Short Ratio. Fifth, Bob Gross interpreted high readings as bearish, since these represented relatively professional shorting compared to public shorting: Low readings were bullish; since represented relatively light professional shorting compared to public shorting: applied heavy they Haurlan Index 295 Haurlan Index The Haurlan Index is a multiple-timeframe market breadth indicator developed by PN. Haurlan, Trade Levels, Inc,, 22801 Ventura Boulevard, Suite 210, Woodland Hills, CA 91364. Generally, NYSE daily data is used, although the same analysis could be to daily and weekly data from other exchanges: The Haurlan Index consists of three components, each with a different purpose and interpretation. The short-term component is a 3-day exponential moving average of the net difference between the number of advancing issues and the number of de- clining issues. The intermediate-term component is a 20-day exponential moving av- erage of the net difference between the number of advancing issues and the number of declining issues. The long-term component is a 200-day exponential moving aver- age of the net difference between the number of advancing issues and the number of declining issues. Each of the three components is interpreted differently: The   intermediate - component (20-day exponential moving average) is interpreted subjectively with and sell signals given when trend lines Or support and resistance levels are crossed. The long-term component (200-day exponential moving average) is not used to generate specific and sell signals. Rather; it is intended to be used to determine the primary trend of stock prices. When the short-term component (3-day exponential moving average) moves above + 100, a signal is given. The buy signal remains in effect until a level of 150 is reached. At that time, a short-term sell signal is generated and remains in ef- fect until the next short-term buy signal: The graph shows that the levels of the Haurlan Index are expanding over time, reflecting an increasing number of issues traded on the New York Stock Exchange. The traditional Haurlan parameters have not allowed for this expansion in levels, but it probably ought to be adjusted for this fact: Indicator Strategy Example for The Haurlan Index, 3-day exponential moving average The already-established, short-term rules lend themselves to objective testing: Based on a 68-year file of daily data for the number of shares advancing and declining each on the NYSE and the DJIA since March &, 1932, found that the stated para- meters would have produced positive result on purely mechanical signal basis with no subjectivity, no sophisticated technical analysis, and no judgement: Enter (Buy) at the current daily price close of the DJIA when the 3-day exponential moving average of the advances minus declines rises above 100. applied buy buy buy day we Long 8 V > EMA Haurlan Equity (727,297) 700000 HAURLAN INDEX: 3 EMA 6o0000 Cumulative Equity Line for Longs and Shorts so0000 when HAURLAN INDEX Crosses Above 100 40o000 Sell when HAURLAN INDEX Crosses Below -150 300000 200o00 10O000 Moving Average 3-EMA (25.50) 1000 W 500 fl} H VwWw 300 -1O00 HAURLAN INDEX: 3 EMA -15001 ~000 10000 5000 Dow-Jones Industrial Average Daily Price Close Semi-Log Scale 11930 1940 950 41960 11970 980 I1990 Buy KanpaHL Haurlan Index: 3-day EMA Total net profit 727197 Open position value Net Profit/Buy&Hold % 5699.64 Percent gain/loss 727197 Annual percent gain/loss 10607.74 Annual Net %/B&H % 5699.75 Initial investment 100 Interest earned Current position Short Date position entered 9/8/00 BuylHold profit 12538.66 Days in test 25022 # of per trade 5.20 Buy/Hold pct gain/loss 12538.66 Annual BIH pct gainlloss 182.9 Total closed trades 4812 Commissions paid Avg profit per trade 151.12 Win/Avg Loss ratio 1.62 Total long trades 2406 Total short trades 2406 Long Win Trade % 54.53 Winning long trades 1312 Winning short trades 823 Short Win Trade % 34.21 Total winning trades 2135 Total losing trades 2677 Total Win Trade % 44.37 Amount of winning trades 3248707 Amount of losing trades 2521506.3 Net Profit Margin % 12.60 Average win 1521.64 Average loss 941.91 Average P.

John Herrick developed the complex formula, which is based on changes in price, volume and open interest: Since it requires data on open interest, it cannot be applied to com- mon stocks. Begin with price velocity times volume, which is called Money Flow Money Flow is multiplied by the absolute value of the daily percentage change in the open interest; and the result is called Modulated Dollar Amount: Finally, that Modulated Dollar Amount is smoothed with an exponential moving average. The resulting oscil- lator moves above and below horizontal reference line at zero. The formula for the Herrick Payoff Index is preprogrammed and appears on the MetaStock@ indicator drop-down window.

In con- trast the Multiplying Factor appears to be the critical variable. This determines the length of the Exponential Moving Average, roughly approximated in days, with small values near the default setting of 10 producing a sensitive short-term trading oscilla- tOr, while large values approaching the maximum setting of 100 produce a slow-mov- ing, long-term oscillator: Possible interpretations of the Herrick Payoff Index include its own or falling trend direction: Also, levels in the oscillator are compared to levels in the of the underlying security, to identify divergences and convergences.

Place a protective stop just above the highest high, then trail your stop down to eventually take profits if the declines as expected. An opposite long strategy could be devised for extremely negative mo- mentum followed by positive divergences It could be named "Lo Mom System' The two together would make a contra-trend trading system that attempts to fade extremes and plays for reversion to the mean, which is actually common in all but the most strongly trending markets. further discussion, see LeBeau, Charles, and Lucas, David W,, Technical Traders Guide to Computer Analysis of the Futures Market, Business One Irwin, Homewood, IL: 1992, 234 pages. High Low Logic Index The High Low Logic Index was developed by Normal Fosback of The Institute for Econometric Research, 3471 North Federal Highway Fort Lauderdale, FL 33306. NYSE data, the index is defined as the lesser of two ratios: the number of new highs divided by the total number of issues traded; or the number of new lows divided by the total number of issues traded. Low levels on this index might imply a strongly trending market in one direction, with many new highs and few new lows, Or with few new highs and many new lows. Similarly, high levels on this index might imply mixed-up two-way market; with many new highs and many new lows, with many stocks trending up while many other stocks are trending down: Fosback tested the NYSE weekly High Low Logic Index over a 40-year period. He first smoothed the raw data with 10-week exponential moving average. He long: price price price quite For Using Holidays 303 found that smoothed index levels above 0.050 were bearish; while levels below 0.010 were bullish: In the first edition of this book; Thomas A. Meyers confirmed Fosback's find- ings. Using chi-squared statistical testing, he independently examined the NYSE weekly High Low Logic Index over longer 50-year period (1937-1987). Meyers found that the following results were highly significant at the 99.9% confidence level: there is not one chance in a thousand that these results could have been obtained by chance alone_ Meyers first smoothed the raw weekly data with a 10-week simple moving av- erage. He found that the highest 5% of observed smoothed weekly index levels above 0.058 were bearish for a 3-months forward time window. On the other side, the low- est 5% of observed smoothed weekly index levels of less than or to 0.005 were bullish for both 3- and 12-months forward time windows_ Meyers also found that the top 10% of raw (not smoothed by moving averages) daily index levels above 0.020 were bearish for both 1- and 3-months forward time windows. The bottom 10%, raw daily levels less than or equal to 0.002, were bullish for 1-_ 3-, and 6-months forward time windows. Smoothing the daily data with a 10-day simple moving average, Meyers found that the lowest 10% of levels less than or equal to 0.002 were bullish over all time frames tested, 1-, 3-, 6- and 12-months forward time windows. The Hindenberg Omen This compound indicator was designed as a warning of major stock market trouble ahead. It was developed by Jim Mikkea of The Sudbury Bull and Bear Report, and it was named by Kennedy Gammage of the Richland Report in remembrance of the Hindenberg disaster: (The Hindenberg was German zeppelin filled with hydrogen gas that exploded and burned, killing 36 people, on 6,1937, on arrival at Lake- hurst; New Jersey:) The Hindenberg Omen requires that all three of the following conditions are met: 1) The lessor of the number of new highs or the number of new lows is more than 2.4% of total issues traded: 2) The 10-week simple moving average of the NYSE Composite Index is rising: 3) The McClellan oscillator is negative. Holidays The stock market is scheduled to open from 9.30 AM to 4 PM Monday through Fri- except for holidays. It used to be open o Saturdays before 26, 1952. The market may occasionally close because of an extreme snow storm or the funeral of a former U.S. president; but it is rare. The market closed for more than four months from 7/13/14 through 12/11/14,because of panic on the outbreak of World War I, and equal May day; May 304 Technical Market Indicators for four trading days following the terrorist attack on the World Trade Towers in New York on Tuesday, 9/11/01. From 1991 through 1999, the stock market was open for trading 252, 253 or 254 days, depending on the calendar: On average the stock market was open for trading 252.7778 days a year: The stock market is regularly closed for holidays nine weekdays a New Year s Martin Luther Jr: Washington'$ Birthday, Good Friday, Memorial Day, Independence Labor Thanksgiving and Christmas Martin Luther Jr: Washington Birthday and Memorial are cel- ebrated on the third Mondays in January, February and respectively. When any holiday falls on Saturday, the market is closed on the preceding Friday: When any holiday falls on Sunday, the market is closed on the succeeding Monday: Arthur A. Merrill, CMT; pioneered the study of seasonal behavior of stock mar- ket in his classic book, Behavior of Prices on Wall Street; Second Edition, The Analysis Press, Chappaqua, New York; 1984, 147 pages. Merrill found that the market has a strong tendency to rise the before most holidays. On average, the DJIA has been up a statistically highly significant 689 of the time the day before a holiday: Merrill found that the best (up 81% to 72% of the time) were the day before Labor Independence Memorial Christ- mas and New Years in that order The day before Election the second Tuesday of November; was up 71% of the time. The day before Good Friday and the before Thanksgiving, however; were only slightly better than average and were, therefore, not significant statistically: There is insufficient data to make any conclusions about market behavior around the newest holiday, Martin Luther Jr: Day: A glaring exception to the bullish holiday rule-the trading day before Presi- dents in February-was actually down slightly more often than not: The af- ter Presidents " was up only 40% of the time, which was significantly bearish: The after a holiday was generally not significant; except for the very bull- ish after Thanksgiving, up 669 of the time. Also, the after Independence was up 60% of the time. "Sell Rosh Hashanah; Yom Kippur;' would have been correct most of the time: the market has been up only 46% of the time between these two High Holy Days. (Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year; is the after the new moon in late September or early October: Yom Kippur; the Jewish of Atonement, follows nine days later; on the tenth of the Jewish New Year:) on July Fourth and sell on Labor and pay your expenses for the year; would have been profitable a statistically significant 669 of the time. Merrill coined the phrase, at Thanksgiving and sell at the New Years and pay Christmas bills. This strategy would have had highly significant success rate of 72% from 1897 to 1983. year Day; King, Day; Day; Day; Day Day: King; Day; Day May; prices day days Day; Day; Day; Day Day; Day; day King; Day day Day day day day Day buy day Day day Buy Day "Buy your Hypothesis Testing 305 Our tests suggest another one: "Sell Labor buy Halloween."

Holy Grail Holy Grail is a particular setup: within a strong uptrend making new highs, and after a minor price pullback to the 20-day exponential moving average, when the moves above the previous day's high. A strong uptrend is defined by a Average Directional Movement (14) above 30 and rising: Place a protective stop just below the recent pullback low and trail the upward. Look to book profits at the recent high. For further details on this see Connors, Laurence and Raschke, Linda Bradford, Street Smarts, High Probability Short-Term Trading Strate- gies, M.

A Hook is also known as a Springboard. Hypothesis Testing Traditional hypothesis testing is designed to verify a hypotheses about relations between variables_ In the world of academic finance, controlled laboratory experiments are not pOS- sible; historical data may be subject to errors and biases Or not be available in suffi- cient quantities; computer testing programs may be vulnerable to certain hidden assumptions, bugs and biases; mathematical theories and formulas may be dependent on unrealistic assumptions; and assumptions must be made about difficult-to-quantify variables such as transactions costs_ Contrast that to the gradual evolution of classic technical analysis, which has been tested with no assumptions, in real time, every day, in all kinds of market con- ditions, over many decades, by many thousands of traders, and with real money: Technical analysis has been hammered out on the hard anvil of harsh market reality every day that traders do their jobs, buying and selling: specifi- Day; good price price buy price price stop swing A:, setup; price priori 306 Technical Market Indicators Indicator Seasons, Elder's Concept There is a time to SOw and a time to reap. Indicator Seasons can show a trader where he is in the market cycle, according to Alexander Elder (Trading for a Living: chology Trading Tactics, Money Management, John Wiley & Sons, Inc  New York, 1993). Elder'$ idea of Indicator Seasons is based on Gerald Appel's Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator: (See Moving Average Convergence Divergence: , To signal trades, Elder uses the position relative to the zero line (above or be- low) and the slope (rising or falling) of the Moving Average Convergence Divergence Histogram (MACDH). Slope is defined as the relationship between the current MACDH and the previous period s MACDH: When the weekly MACDH is below zero and its slope turns positive, it is springtime in the market and time to Hold a long position until the weekly MACDH moves above zero_it is now summer and time to start selling: When the weekly MACDH is above zero and its slope turns negative, it is fall in the market and time to sell short. Hold a short position until the weekly MACDH moves below zero_it is now winter and time to start covering shorts. Indicator Seasons, Colby's Variation Elder s original concept, as outlined on pages 188-192 of his book, did not perform well in our independent tests. But we found a variation using daily data and modified rules for interpretation that would have substantially outperformed the market; with- out any optimization: When the daily MACDH is above zero and its slope is positive, it is springtime in the market and time to Hold a long position as long as the daily MACDH re- mains above zero and its slope is positive. Liquidate longs when either the daily MACDH crosses under zero or its turns downward_ When the daily MACDH is below zero and its slope is negative, it is time for the market to fall. Therefore, it is time to sell short. Hold short position as as the daily MACDH remains below zero and its slope is negative.

This idea has long been attractive to market technicians, some of whom are also highly trained in the physical sciences. The Inertia indicator was developed by Donald G Dorsey and first introduced in the September 1995 issue of Technical Analysis of Stocks Commodities maga- zine (www.traders.com). Dorsey' s Inertia indicator is simply a smoothed version of his Relative Volatility Index (see Relative Volatility Index) Dorsey reasoned that it takes significantly more energy for a market to reverse direction than to continue along the same path: He used momentum to quantify the direction of price motion and volatility as a measurement of inertia. Dorsey de- fined Inertia as smoothed Relative Volatility Index (RVI) His preferred smoothing mechanism is Linear Regression (see Linear Regression). The RVI measures the gen- eral direction of volatility: If the Inertia indicator is above 50, positive inertia is indicated. The long-term trend is up and should remain up as long as the indicator is above 50. If Inertia is below 50, negative inertia is indicated. The long-term trend is down and should remain down as long as the indicator is below 50. Our Indicator Strategy testing for Dorsey' s Inertia indicator confirms that Iner- tia indeed lives up to its name ~it is inert: By smoothing the RVI; Inertia filters out even more signals than RVI: In fact; it eliminates nearly all signals Meanwhile it prO- duces a level of profitability not significantly better than the passive buy-and-hold strategy: (See Relative Volatility Index (RVI)) Insiders' Sell/Buy Ratio An insider is an officer; director; or beneficial owner of a company'$ stock: Insiders of companies with publicly traded securities are required to report any changes in di- rect O indirect holdings to the Securities and Exchange Commission no later than the tenth day of the month following the month of the transaction: In an effort to prevent insiders from taking advantage of access to materially significant information before it is made available to the public, insiders are legally prohibited from realizing a from their transactions within at least six months. If an insider should realize a within six months, any shareholder may challenge the publicly reported transaction, and the insider could be required to return any such short-term to the company. Insiders are in position to acquire superior information and insight into the prospects for their companies. Therefore, it is logical that would when their price profit _ profit gains they buy Insiders' SellBuy Ratio 315 company'$ fortunes are about to improve, Or when the stock price has fallen irre- sistibly far below its intrinsic value. People buy a stock when have positive ex- pectations about the stock's future performance. Logically, Insiders ought to be motivated to sell their stock when the company' $ future prospects are likely to deteriorate, or when the stock price has risen too far above its intrinsic value. It is said that insiders sometimes sell stocks in order to diversify, to raise funds for personal and family expenditures, for philanthropy, for estate planning and for other reasons not necessarily related to a stock's investments merits. As a result in- siders' future expectations for their company'$ stock may be not always completely obvious judging by their stock sales: Vickers weekly Insider Sell/Buy Ratio rates each company'$ insider transac- tions for the past six months, taking into account the following; weighted by relative importance: 1. The number of insider buy and sell transactions for each company 2. The percentage change in an insider's holdings with each purchase Or sale 3. Unanimity among a given company' $ insiders, either all buys o all sells. 4 Reversals in insiders buying patterns, either a change from buying to selling; or a change from selling to buying 5. Transactions involving $250,000 or more dollar   value are given  added weight Vickers publishes its weekly Insider Sell/Buy Ratio and an 8-week moving av- erage of the ratio. Vickers considers a ratio of 2.25 neutral, under 2.25 suggests a ris- market, and greater than 2.25 suggests heavy insider selling and a weakening market: The average Insider Sell/Buy Ratio is 1.99 over the past quarter century: The original source of data on insider   trading is Vickers Stock Re- search  Corporation, wholly owned subsidiary of the Argus Research Group, WWW.argusgroup.com.

The paper won the annual Charles H: Dow Award for market analysis. Unusually low insider selling is bullish and unusually high insider selling is bearish. Insiders normally are net sellers on balance, in increasing amounts over time. To normalize the data for their analysis, the authors used a 10-week average dollar amount of net insider selling as a percentage of total market capitalization: From 1983 into 1999, a of 16.3 years, the normalized 10-week average dollar amount of net insider selling spent 85.69 of its time within a normal range from 0.019 to 0.079 of total market capitalization. This means that the normalized average spent 14.49 of its time outside that normal range. Of that outside normal range-time (100.0%), insiders spent more time engaging in unusually high selling (60.49, than engaging in unusually low selling (39.69). In other words; the normal- ized average spent 1.4 years or 74 weeks or 8.79 of the total time of 16.3 years in the price price days. for opt2 period 320 Technical Market Indicators high selling zone. The normalized average spent 0.9 years or 48 weeks o 5.79 of the total time of 16.3 years in the low selling zone_ From 1983 to late 1990, the normalized average showed net buying o only three occasions, and each time a bear market bottom occurred within weeks. When insider net selling has been unusually low, the S&P 500 has outperformed its average performance by several percentage going forward 3,6, 9 and 12 months ahead: Low selling identified the market bottoms of 1984, 1987 and 1990 within several weeks But there was not a single instance of an unusually low level of insider selling from late 1990 to the time of the paper in 1999. Insider's Net Selling Levels S&P 500 Average Return Months 6 Months 9 Months 12 Months High ~0.6% 3.5% 7.0% 0.3% Normal 3.7% 7.2% 10.7% 14.8% Low 6.0% 10.4% 13.5% 17.7% The * Insider s Net Selling Levels" table shows that when insider selling has been High;' the S&P 500 underperformed "Normal" substantially, especially 12 months ahead. A rapid increase in insider net selling often preceded Or coincided with market weakness and volatility. However; the signals were 6 to 12 months early: For example, insider net selling peaked in March 1987, but the market did not crash until months later in October 1987. Also, the insider selling spike in the fall of 1989 was immediately followed by a market; but the S&P 500 did not collapse un - til August 1990. The table also shows that when insider selling has been "Low;' the S&P 500 has outperformed "Normal" by 2.3 to 3.2 percentage points. Big Block transactions were defined as those involving more than 100,000 shares or a total transaction value greater than $1,000,000. Corporate insiders increased selling following the SEC $ 1997 code revision shortening the holding _ of restricted shares Also in 1997, there was a long-term maximum capital tax rate cut to 20%. Both of these changes have encouraged increasing selling by insiders. Normalizing the data by adjusting for the growth of the stock market over time allows a better historical perspective. This also shows net insider selling increasing since 1991. Insider trading laws prohibit 'material, non-public information" for fi- nancial Still, insiders' insights into the probable success or failure of future COI- porate plans naturally influence insiders decisions about when and whether to or sell company stock. Consequently, insider transactions reflect insights that might not points price choppy period gains using gain. buy Intermarket Divergences 321 be available in cautiously worded company news releases_ Since the stock market is the sum of all public firms, it follows that the aggregate buying and selling patterns of all insiders could offer insights into future prospects of the stock market: The SEC makes information on insider'$ transactions available weekly. By law, all corporate insiders (and beneficial owners who hold 10% Or more of outstanding shares , are required to file Form 4 by the tenth of the month following a transac- tion: Each week the latest filings are compiled and published in Vicker'$ Weekly In- sider: The transactions of corporations, foundations, trusts and other institutional shareholders are ignored, since these transactions are often motivated by factors that have nothing to do with the financial prospects of a company: Insiders and sell transactions are summed for a weekly aggregate net dollar amount of selling and buying: Most of the time, selling is much greater than buying: Weeks of net selling outnumber weeks of net buying 12 to 1. Insiders sell transac - tions include the sale of stock resulting from the exercise of options, although no COI- responding transaction occurs when options are issued. In the seven years from 1992 to 1999,the sell/buy ratio climbed to 50 to 1, partly due to increasing use of op- tions to compensate corporate insiders As option issuance and market capitalization increased, net selling has drifted upward, so the data must be normalized by dividing by total market capitalization: While the dollar amount measures the magnitude of insider'$ transactions, the net number of transactions measures the breadth of net sells/buys. Normally the two data series move together: Occasionally, the weekly net dollar amount of net selling surges, but the net number of sell transactions remains flat. This indicates that there were one or more unusually large transactions during that particular week, for exam- ple, huge blocks of Texaco in July 1989, Duracell in 1995, and Microsoft in March 1998. When insider data shows both record dollar amounts and record num- bers of net sell transactions; market peak follows. In 1983, 1987, 1993 and late 1989, selling surges foreshadowed significant drops. Three later selling surges in the 1990s were followed by market price consolidation. A set of sell signals 0c- curred during Q2 of 1998, offering a timely warning of the market decline dur- Q3 of 1998. Intermarket Divergences The trader first identifies two (OT more) closely equivalent financial instruments that trade separately: When two prices diverge, by one not moving to a proportionately similar extent O in a similar direction as the other; the trader initiates a trade.

On pages 10-11,he revealed the 'Behavior Through the Day;" based on a tally of hourly price changes from Janu- ary 1962 through December 1974. It may be significant to note that during this period the Dow-Jones Industrial Average fell from 731.14 to 616.24, a decline of 18.659. Merrill found that the hour-by-hour pattern today depends on the trend yester- day. If the DJIA rose yesterday, then the market opened higher 70% of the time. Next, during the first hour of trading, 62% of the time the market continued to move higher: After that bullish first full hour of trading, during the middle of the 53% to 559 of the time there was profit taking and downward price movement: During the next to last hour of trading; 53% of the time there was movement. Finally, dur- the last hour of trading, 54% of the time there was downward movement presumably as traders closed out long positions The daily pattern was much different following a down day: Merrill found that if the DJIA fell the previous then the next the market opened lower 659 of the time. After the open, there was slight tendency for the market to continue to de- cline, on average, although that depended on the particular of the week On Mon- there was definite tendency for the market to continue to move lower through the close. But this clear bearish bias was less pronounced on Wednesdays and Thurs- days.

Tappan; Intraday Trading, Day Trading, Behavior of Prices Through the 325 Hirsch recently published a study of half-hourly price changes from January 1987 through December 1999. It may be significant to note that during this period the DJIA rose from 1895.95 to 11497.12, a remarkable increase of 506.409. Based on this bullish bias, we reasonably might expect to find significantly bullish tendencies, but such was hardly the case_ The most consistent tendency was to rise late in the particularly the last half hour from 3.30 to the close at 4 PM, but even that occurred only 559 of the time. Also, the half hour from 2.30 to 3 PM was bullish every day of the week, on average, but only 53% of the time. On balance, the last 1.5 hours from 2.30 to the close at PM were up a bit more than half of the time. The open tended to be higher about 54% of the time, every day but Monday, when it was down 54% of the time. There was a decline from 10 to 10.30 AM, about 53% of the time. The rest of the day the market action was remarkable only for its complete statistical insignificance. Tendencies evident a little more or less than half the time are hardly better than flipping a coin and far from enough to inspire confidence in trading: Moreover; intra- tendencies are easily overwhelmed by news reports and rumors that surface at unpredictable times during the traders die broke, is an old saying on Wall Street: An August 1999, study by the North American Securities Administration Association (NASAA) found that 709 of the customers at a day-trading firm surveyed lost money: Only 11.S9 of the traders in the sampling showed had the ability to conduct profitable short-term trading, even during a record-breaking bull market trend traders exchange limited risk for limited reward. At the end of the month, & long list of small and small losses have to offset commissions, slippage, fees, and taxes and other expenses that the trader must pay. Trading is a highly competitive business with many thousands of competitors fighting hard with each other trying to win small fractions of a dollar The advantage lies with the house and the market mak- ers_ But even their jobs are far from easy; and have been known to lose large sums in difficult market environments. It has long been said that the typical investor is much more likely to from major price trends that last for months or even years, as opposed to the relatively in- significant price ripples that occur within trading day: Even short-term traders can benefit from stepping back from the confusion of daily fluctuations to see the bigger picture, the major trends beyond the reach of day-to-day random noise. The value of a major trend perspective has long been recognized by astute tech- nical analysts. Nearly seven decades ago, Richard W. Schabacker emphasized that short-term traders are likely to be more successful when trade in harmony with the direction of the major trend, rather than trying to capture every minor move.

Hirsch's Al- manac provides annual updates on the January Barometer and variety of other interesting calendar-based statistical studies The January Barometer is simply the up or down direction of the S&P 500 Com- Stock Price Index in the month of January, from the closing level of the last trading of December to the last trading day of January just one month later: From 1950 through 2000, the January Barometer has correctly predicted all of the 25 S&P moves in excess of 14% for the full-year: For all 51 years, this simple January direction has effectively predicted the full- year direction of stock market 829 of the time: it has been right 42 times out of the past 51 years. Years beginning with January were followed by up full years 31 out of 33 times, or 949 of the time. In 1994, the indicator missed by only 1.5%. The only other loss was in 1966, when a January was followed by a full-year decline of 13.19, which was not a major market loss  In general, the larger the in January, the larger the for the full The indicator is not quite as accurate on its bearish forecasts. Following 18 Jan- uary losses, the full year was down 1l times, Or 61% of the time_ The unusually per - sistent and powerful bull market that started in 1982 overwhelmed this indicator to some extent; accounting for three of the wrong bearish forecasts that were followed by price gains by year end. Following its small error in 1994, the January Barometer has been back o track; 100% correct; for the most recent six years. Oddly; over the 51 years, the January Barometer has never missed in odd- numbered years, such as 2001. So, for years ending in an odd number; it has a perfect record_ Of course, perfect records always have a special allure. Everyone would like to be right all of the time. But if we choose to live in reality, must ask ourselves if the January Barometer might be just some statistical quirk; a mere historical coincidence. Thoughtful analysts are troubled by the absence of compelling and logical ratio- nale behind this indicator: A prudent analyst might look to other indicators for confirmation In fact; that is good idea when any one indicator; no matter how logical and accurate it may seem. Times change and markets change. Few indicators, no matter how impressive, can be expected to sustain overwhelming accuracy through the years. Long experi- ence with markets clearly shows that the search for perfection will no doubt remain elusive and in all probability counter productive. posite price day prices gains gain gain gain year: past we any using 328 Technical Market Indicators JANUARY BAROMETER IN GRAPHIC FORM % Loss JANUARY CHANGE % Gain % Loss FULL YEAR CHANGE % Gain ~8 -6 -4 22 10   12 14 ~20 -10 10 20 30 40 13.2 1987 2.0 12.3 1975 31.5 11.8 1976 19.1 7.8 1967 20.1 7.4 1985 26.3 7.1 1989 27.3 6.3 1961 23.1 6.1 1997 31.0 6.1 1951 16.5 5.8 1980 25.8 5.1 1954 45.0 4.9 1963 18.9 4.3 1958 38.1 4.2 1991 26.3 4.1 1999 19.5 4.0 1971 10.8 4.0 1988 12.4 4.0 1979 12.3 3.3 1965 9.1 33 1983 17.3 3,3 1996 20.3 33 1994 1.5 2.7 1964 13.0 24 1995 34.1 1.8 1972 15.6 1.8 1955 26.4 1.7 1950 21.8 1.6 1952 11.8 1.0 1998 26.7 0.7 1993 7.1 0.5 1966 13.1 0.4 1959 8,5 0.2 1986 14.6 0.7 1953 6.6 0.8 1969 ~1144 0.9 1984 1.0 1974 229.7 1.7 1973 517.4 1.8 Bear markets 1982 14.8 2.0 started or 1992 4.5 3.6 continued 1956 2.6 3.8 except for 1962 11.8 _42 flat 1956 1957 14.3 ~4.4 and 1992. 1968 ~4.6 Turnarounds 1981 9.7 5.1 occured in 1977 11.5 1968 and 2000 6,2 1982. 1978 13 6.9 1990 6.6 _71 1960 3.0 57,6 1970 0.1 Based on S&P 500 Reprinted with permission of Yale Hirsch, Stock Traders Almanac, The Hirsch Organization, Inc,, 184 Central Avenue, Old Tappan, NJ 07675_ WWW.stocktradersalmanac.com_ January Barometer 329 ONLY THREE SIGNIFICANT ERRORS IN 50 YEARS Since 1950, the January Barometer has predicted the annual course of the stock market with amazing accuracy  Based on whether Standard & Poor s 50O index is up Or down in January, most years (excluding four flat years 1970, 1978, 1984,and 1994) have, in essence, followed suit 45 out of S0 times for a 90% batting average.

Hirsch's Almanac provides annual updates on a variety of interesting cal- endar-based statistical studies. If the S&P 500 Composite Stock Price Index goes up during the first five trad- ing days of the year; the market for the whole year tends to go up. Since 1950, this bullish Early Warning has worked 27 out of 31 times, or 879 of the time. Yale Hirsch suggests that three of the four misses might have been thrown off by war news_Viet- nam in 1966 and 1973,and Irag-Kuwait in 1990. Indeed, history strongly suggests that war often coincides with jittery, unpredictable stock market movements. The op- side of the early January coin has not been accurate since 1950; that is, bearish signals have not been significant: But before the unusual bull market that started in 1982, when the S&P 500 Composite Stock Price Index fell during the first five trad- days of the year; the market for the whole year went down 73% of the time. Alas, the powerful bullish trend since 1982 reduced that tendency to less-than coin-flip ac- curacy: The statistics for the indicator are now correct only 479 of the time, with the full-year S&P down only 9 of the 19 early decline years. With eroding accuracy rates and no logical underlying rationale, January' s First Five Early Warning System is best used only in conjunction with confirmation by other indicators.

Alternately, the reversal amount could be defined as percent- age change. But when the closing moves in the opposite direction by less than the reversal amount, no new lines are drawn on the Kagi Chart: When the current closing moves beyond the previous column's high o low, the thickness of the Kagi line changes. Specifically, when a thin Kagi line pene- trates (rises above) the previous high on the Kagi chart, the line becomes thick In contrast;, when a thick Kagi line violates (falls below) a previous low point 0 the Kagi chart, the line becomes thin: The chart shows the one dollar reversal amount Kagi Chart for the S&P De- positary Receipts (SPY) for the full year 2000, January through December; drawn with MetaStock software.

Further; these standard deviations may be corrected for skew Skew is biased to the upside in price because there is an absolute limit to how far down price can fall. Optionally, the user may weight these stops by the volatility of the mar- ket and by risk tolerance. For example, when a market becomes unusually volatile or uncertain, the user may reduce risk by shifting to tighter stop level. Reasonable volatility trends may allow stop at three standard deviations. Kase PeakOscillator (KPO) is an adaptive momentum oscillator that automati- cally searches for the most significant cycle length. KPO is designed to express velocity in terms that have common meaning across time frames, instruments, and units of measure Kase PeakOut Lines are overbought and oversold extremes at the 9Oth per- centile on the distribution curve.

For price price pulls Keltner Channel with EMA Filter 337 Keltner Channel with EMA Filter Keltner Channel is based on two bands, plotted above and below a moving average. It is similar to Envelopes and Bollinger Bands except it uses Average True Range in- stead of percentages (Envelopes) or standard deviations (Bollinger Bands). The upper band is the moving average plus some multiple of the Average True Range (ATR) The lower band is the moving average minus a multiple of the Average True Range. Typically, the upper band is used to define an overbought market that may be due for downward correction. The lower band defines an oversold market that may be due for an upward correction. For example, we might a position when the cur- rent closing price is less than the previous day'$ 4-day exponential average minus 779 of the previous day's 4-day ATR. We might sell and sell short when the current closing is greater than the previous day's 4-day exponential average plus 779 of the previous day's 4-day ATR. To filter out some losing trades and thus improve overall results, various longer-term filters could be added to force the to trade only with the major trend: Indicator Strategy Example for Keltner Channel with EMA Filter Keltner Channel with EMA Filter is a moderately profitable indicator with moderate drawdowns and a large majority of profitable trades It is based on mechanical over- boughtloversold signals filtered by a long-term moving average to define the more significant trend and weed out many countertrend trades.

That is, when the current price high rises above the previous period's price high by the minimum unit of price measurement.  Sell when L is less than Lp. That is, sell when the current price low falls below the previ- ous period $ price low by the minimum unit of price measurement A lthough this sim - ple system looks good at times in simulation, in actual trading it can be a surprisingly costly strategy when transaction costs are significant and the action is choppy (See Keltner; Chester W. How to Make Money in Commodities; The Keltner Statisti- cal Service, Kansas City, 1960.) Keltner's 10-Day Moving Average Rule Keltner's 10-Day Moving Average Rule buys when the current day'$ high crosses an upper band and sells when the current day's low crosses a lower band. The upper and lower bands are the 10-day simple moving average of the daily range (high mi- nus low) added to and subtracted from the 10-day simple moving average of the Typ- ical Price, which is the day's high plus the low plus the close, divided by three. (See Keltner; Chester W_, How to Make Money in Commodities, The Keltner Statistical Service, Kansas 1960.) Reversal bullish Reversal is defined as a where the current day's low is below the previous day's low and the current day's close is above the previous day'$ close. Long positions are closed on the first lower close. A bearish Reversal is defined as a where the current day's high is above the previous day's high and the current day'$ close is below the previous day'$ close. Short position are closed on the first higher close. This would have been an unprofitable trading strategy, on both the long and short sides, over 19-years of S&P 500 futures trading: The Equis International MetaStock@ System Testing rules are written as follows: Enter long: L < Ref(L,-1) AND C > Ref(C,-1) Close long: C < Ref(C,-1) Enter short: H > Ref(H,-1) AND € < Ref(C,-1) Close short: €C > Ref(C,-1) Key Day buy - Buy price price City; Key Day Key day Key day 342 Technical Market Indicators Reversal with Filters A Reversal with Filters might begin as a simple Reversal and, in addition, require that in order to enter long the current day's low must be a minimum amount below the previous day's low and the longer-term trend must be bullish. Similar fil- ters could be added for the specific sell rule. This may be best illustrated with a spe- cific example.

Klinger: It is computed in seven steps: 1. Find the average of the by summing the high, low and close, then dividing by three. 2_ If today's average price is greater than the previous day'$ average price, as- sign a plus sign to today's volume. 3. If today's average price is less than the previous day'$ average price, assign minus sign to today'$ volume. 4 Calculate a 34-period exponential moving average of the signed vol- ume from Steps 2 and 3 5. Calculate a 55-period exponential moving average of the signed vol- ume from Steps 2 and 3_ 6. Subtract the 34-period exponential moving average from the 55-period ex- ponential moving average, and plot the difference. 7_ Calculate and plot a 13-period exponential moving average of the daily dif- ferences from 6_ When today' $ average price is greater than yesterday' $ average price, that is ac- cumulation. Conversely, when today's average price is less than yesterday'$ average price, that is distribution. When the sums are equal, the of demand and supply are in balance. The average difference between the number of shares being accumu- lated and distributed each is the volume force. A rising trend of volume force is bullish, while a trend of volume force is bearish: The Klinger Oscillator is compared to price to identify divergences. (See Volume: Klinger Oscillator (KO)) KST (Know Sure Thing) KST (Know Sure Thing) is a complex, smoothed velocity indicator developed by Martin J. and described in Martin on Market Momentum, McGraw- Hill, New York 1993, 335 pages It is a combined indicator; with an enormous num- ber of possible combinations. Just in case we become too excited by the "Sure Thing" implied promise in the name of this indicator; out (on page 155), "it's also important to know that this approach is not a sure Clearly, there can be no sure in investing; but some indicators are better than others, so we continue OUC search for the best ones.

Compute four different, progressively longer length, rates of change of price, for four different measures of price velocity Pring suggests increasing the lengths by about one-third to one-half each time. For example, Pring uses rates of change of 9, 12, 18,and 24 months for his long-term version of KST; which he says is most reliable. 2_ Smooth the first three shorter velocities with a 26-month Exponential Moving Average. Smooth the longest 24-month rate of change with a 39- month Exponential Moving Average. 3_ Weight each of the four smoothed velocities with progressively higher weight assigned to the longer period-length smoothed velocities. Specifi- weight the shortest by 1, weight the next shortest by 2, weight the third length by 3, and weight the longest by 4_ 4 Sum these four weighted and smoothed price velocities (from 3) , then divide by the sum of the weights, which is 10. This is the basic KST: 5. Compute a 9-month Exponential Average of the basic KST (from 4) for use as a signal line. 6. Plot the basic KST (from 4) and its 9-month EMA signal line (from 5) on a graph under the price. Interpretation of KST depends on: KST crossing the signal line (the 9-month Exponential Moving Averages of itself): crossing above is bullish; crossing below is bearish: KST direction (slope): rising is bullish, falling is bearish. 9-month EMA signal line direction (slope): rising is bullish, falling is bearish: Trendline breaks on KST andlor its 9-month EMA signal line.

Overbought/Oversold considerations "Generally speaking; the monthly KST is far more reliable than its daily and weekly counterparts, " Pring wrote in Technical Analysis Explained, McGraw-Hill, New York 1993, 521 pages, page 169.

The Large Block Ratio (also known as the Big Block Index) is cal- culated by dividing the volume of large block trades by the total volume on the York Stock Exchange. The ratio may be smoothed by moving averages of various lengths to reduce noise and identify signals. There are two very different approaches to interpreting this indicator: Accord- ing to Contrary Opinion adherents, the Large Block Ratio can be viewed as an overboughtloversold sentiment indicator that reflects feelings of either enthusiasm Or disgust of the usually wrong institutional investors. Since institutional portfolios do not keep up with unmanaged market indexes, contrarians look to "fade" them that is, to sell when institutions are buying and when institutions are selling: The problem with that reasoning is that institutions are not usually wrong, are merely relatively poor performers Even though institutional performance (in the aggregate) has been below average, institutions do earn positive returns, so doing the opposite of the institutions will earn negative returns. Nevertheless, to contrarians a high level on this ratio implies an unsustainable level of optimism, while a low level implies insti- tutional apathy or discouragement. Contrarians believe that indicator extremes and excesses precede reversals in the financial markets. Our tests of the data contradict this contrary view: the relationship between large block activity and subsequent market performance is positive oe, and high Big Block ratios are bullish while low ratios are not: Using data and software provided by Equis International, WWWequis.com; we tested daily data compressed into weekly format from 1983 to 2001. We found that when the Large Block Ratio crossed above its own trailing 104-week exponential moving average, it gave buy signals that would have been profitable 70% of the time with a net profit of 5119 for trades only This strategy exited when the ra- tio crossed below this trailing 104-week exponential moving average. But crossing below the 104-week exponential moving average would have given short sale signals that would have been profitable only 40% of the time with a net loss of 399. Shorter moving average lengths would have produced similar but less profitable results Seasoned traders know that volume is a weapon of the bull: it takes volume to push higher; but can fall of their own weight in the absence of the ing interest reflected in the volume data. Likewise, high Large Block activity is bull- ish and low Large Block activity is not so bullish. Reaching a similar conclusion; Arthur A_ Merrill, CMT, found his version of Large Block Transactions was itable and highly significant statistically: New New buy they long longs  prices prices buy- prof- Least Squares Method 355 Large Block Transactions Arthur A. Merrill, CMT; defines large blocks as transactions of more than 50,000 shares. Using daily data published in Barron $ at the end of each week, Merrill quan- tifies the behavior of the operators in 8 steps. 1. data for a full week (usually five but sometimes only four trading days) , separately sum the daily numbers of large blocks traded on upticks, on downticks, and on unchanged ticks. Do this for three different weekly totals. 2. Smooth these three different weekly totals with 13-weeks exponential mov- averages. 3. Subtract the downtick average from the average (using the results from 2)_ 4 Divide that difference (from 3) by the unchanged average (from 2). 5. Compute a 52-weeks moving average of that ratio. 6. Calculate deviations of the current ratio (from Step 4 from its 52-weeks moving average (from Step 5). 7_ Divide these deviations by their trailing standard deviation over the preced- 52 weeks. 8_ Interpret resulting ratios as follows: a ratio above 0.67 is bullish a ratio below 0.67 is bearish Using a chi-squared test of significance, Merrill found that these ratios correctly predicted the direction of the general market 669 of the time over the next 13 weeks, 81% of the time over the next 26 weeks, and 76% of the time over the next 52 weeks. All of these results are highly significant statistically However; market behavior over the next one and five weeks was insignificant Least Squares Method The Least Squares Method is a statistical technique for fitting a straight line to an in- dependent variable, or observed data, such that the sum of the squares of the devia- tions of the observed data points from the straight line are minimized.

It is commonly used with and time data to identify trends. Mathematically the linear regression formula is represented as: y = a + bx where y = the closing X the position of the current time period in the database. a = Iln (Ey - bEx) b = (nExy - ExEyynEx? _ (Ex)? number of time periods in the summations. 2 Summation symbol, sum over n periods. Linear Regression uses the least squares method to fit a trendline to the data. It arrives at the best fit by minimizing the distance between the given data points and the fitted Linear Regression trendline. MetaStock software (wWW.= com) predefines the formula for the Linear Regression trendline on its indicator menu. The software plots any Linear Re- gression Line at the end date of the calculation. Thus, the current Linear Re- gression Line is plotted at today's date. For all practical purposes, this Linear Regression Line changes every day; trailing and tracking the current price, much like trailing moving average. Therefore, this indicator may be interpreted much like the better known moving average. Also, the current relationship between and the current n-day Linear Re- gression Line may be viewed as an oscillator: As shown in the chart; we may divide the current close by the current trailing 5-day Linear Regression Line of the most recent 5-day closing prices. In MetaStock formula language, that could be ex- pressed as CLOSE/LinearReg(CLOSE,S) price price. equis.

Large liquidity represents future buying power and is potentially bullish. On the other hand, low liquidity suggests that buying power is used up and that relatively little cash is in reserve to support prices at current levels, and that is potentially bearish. Far-sighted technical analysts (such as Ralph Acampora, CMT; who quite correctly forecasted Dow 7,000 then 10,000, years in advance) take into account distant future liquidity and money flows based on long-term demographic projections Trading liquidity refers to the amount of trading activity, the ease and rapidity of executions, the narrowness of spreads, the size of real bids and offers (depth of the market), and the absence of slippage on market orders Active traders who act on short-term timing signals should focus only o active and deep markets, otherwise slippage on executions could erode theoretical paper profits. Even the most liquid markets suffer from occasional order imbalances in so called "fast markets. Trading at times of big news events O other general mass emo- tional excess can be surprisingly costly. In fast markets, going with the majority, when everyone else wants to or selling when everyone else wants to sell, often results in shockingly bad fills (executions) It also offers a probability of buying at the top and selling at the bottom; which is the formula for instant losses Conversely, doing just the opposite, going against the majority at times of general emotional excessive reactions, if timed well, can result in unusually good fills. Good or bad executions make a very big difference real trading: Inactive markets   with low volume and few participants generally have the widest bid-ask spreads and largest slippage on market orders. Executions on market orders for inactive, illiquid instruments in fast markets can be extremely costly, with very large slippage. Patience and limit orders may limit the damage. Livermore Swing System, Livermore Penetration Filter The Livermore Swing System was developed by famous speculator; Jesse Liver- more, in the 1920's. This uses two filters: a swing filter of x%, and a penetra- tion filter of one-half the size of the filter: An uptrend is defined on the chart by higher highs and higher lows. A downtrend is defined on the chart by lower lows and lower highs. For example, assume a swing filter 4% and penetration filter of 2%. After a downtrend, which is a series of lows and highs, close out short positions buy- ing buy; good system swing swing swing lower lower Lowry's Reports 365 when rises by the amount of the swing filter (4%) and exceeds the most recent previous swing high by the amount of the penetration filter (2%). Next, establish new positions when the next most recent previous swing high is exceeded by the amount of the penetration filter (2%). Thus, the two most recent swing highs each must be exceeded by 2% in order to completely reverse from short to long: Conversely, after an uptrend, which is a series of higher highs and higher lows, close out positions when falls by the amount of the swing filter (49, and breaks the most recent previous low by the amount of the penetration filter (29). Next; establish new short positions when the next most recent previous low is broken by the amount of the penetration filter (2%). Thus; the two most recent lows each must be broken by 2% in order to completely reverse from to short. Lowry's Reports In 1938, the late Lyman M. Lowry originated the idea of compiling Upside and Downside Volume statistics in an effort to objectively quantify the basic forces of demand and supply for stocks and the underlying condition of the stock market in general. The company he founded, Lowry's Reports, publishes proprietary indices of Buying Power and Selling Pressure, NYSE Operating-Companies-Only Statistics, Advance-Decline, Points Gained and Lost, and Upside and Downside Volume. These indices use raw statistics for all domestic, ordinary New York Stock Exchange listed common stock issues, while specifically excluding all preferred stocks, ADRS, closed end mutual funds, REITS and other non-ordinary issues. In addition, Lowry offers proprietary Power Ratings to analyze sectors, industry groups, and individual stocks. Preprocessed technical indicators, both current and historical data, but not the actual proprietary algorithms, may be purchased from Lowry's Reports, Inc , 631 U.S. Highway 1_ #305, North  Palm Beach; FL 33408, Phone (561) 842-3514, www.lowryreports.com_ The chart (courtesy of Ned Davis Research), shows that Lowry's Short-Term Buying Power oscillator fully oversold levels below 60 appear to have effectively identified major market bottoms. Also, this oscillator has given some useful diver- gence signals, such as a higher low at the 1982 market bottom and a lower high at the 1987 market top. In contrast, reflecting the increasing levels of price and volume, the longer-term Buying Power and Selling Pressure lines have shown distinct upward bias, but that still did not prevent them from giving misleading negative divergences at the bottoms of 1987, 1990, 1992, 1994, 1996,and 1997. Obviously, these lines re- quire a different and more complex interpretation, compared to most other indicators. price long long price swing swing swing long g Wekly Data 1705779 5122798 Dow Jones Industrial Average 9473 Dow Jones Industrials 797 1 Scale Right 6707 5644 4749 3978.16 3996 3591.35 3362 2990.78 2829 540 2365.10 2381 520 4i 2003 500 1755.20 1730.74 Lowry"# Buving Power ( 1686 Scele Lott 480 1418 1193 460 1024.05 1016.57 1004 90} . 440 845 420 739.13 776.92 4o0 380 360 340 320 mMn Lowry'8 Salling Ftoesurc 280 Scela Lett 260 140 105 100 Overisold Shont-Torm Buying Power Source: Low"s Reports; 7 Scele Ajoht N Rlm Beoch FL 01435) 3 8 2 2 : 8 ! ! ! ! ! ! !  8 Chart by permission of Ned Davis Research Lop 300 Inc. Lowry's Reports 367 According to Bishop and Rollins, general market activity can be reduced to four basic totals: Total dollars gained each Total volume of transactions for stocks moving up; Total dollars lost each day; Total volume of transactions for stocks moving down. To smooth out short-term fluctuations, Lowry's aggregates these totals over ap- proximately 50 and 15 trading days to produce and short term indices of supply and demand. Lowry'$ employs specific rules for interpretation, involving overbought and oversold conditions, signs showing when prevailing pressures are dissipating, and Safety Controls to alert users when to cut losses on existing positions In a study uS- 25 years of past daily data applying all of Lowry'$ interpretation rules, Bishop and Rollins concluded that the Lowry's Reports signals "led to returns significantly in ex- cess of those achieved by naive buy-and-hold programs from 1950 to 1975. Also, this study indicated that extraordinary can be achieved by sophisticated technical analysis For complete details, see Bishop, E.L & Rollins, J. R.

The Lucas difference is the starting or the initial values, which are the integers 2 and 1, in that reverse O- der: Thus, Lucas derived the following sequence: 2, 1,3,4,7,11, 18,29,47,76, 123, 199, 322, 421,743, 1164, Lucas Numbers are not as well-known nor as widely used as the much more popular Fibonacci Numbers. point Margin Debt 375 Margin The initial margin requirement is set by the Fed or the exchange. For most stocks 509 of the purchase is required. (For the riskiest stocks 100% is required.) The investor out half of the total purchase price, and his broker lends him the re- maining 50% with interest The initial margin requirement is usually much less for most futures contracts. Margin offers both opportunity and substantial danger: Lever- age is defined as 100% minus margin. Leverage and margin are two-edged swords that must be handled with care Margin Debt Margin Debt represents the total amount that customers owe their brokerage firms as result of borrowing through their stock margin accounts. Margin Debt statistics are released on monthly basis by the New York Stock Exchange. Most of the time, margin debt follows the trend of the market and yields few significant clues for market timing: In a general bull market trend, the percentage of troubled margin accounts, with equity less than 40%, drops to a low level. Such market is healthy and not vulnerable to involuntary margin selling on normal pullbacks In the later stages of a bear market; however; margin debt becomes more inter- esting: After stock prices already have dropped substantially, the percentage of mar- gin debt in troubled accounts, with equity less than 40%, rises to high levels. In the event of any further significant decline in stock prices, such accounts are vulnerable to forced liquidation through margin calls This can create an avalanche of selling; producing selling climax , and a final clean-out of the weak hands. Once the selling runs its course and troubled margin accounts are fully liquidated, stock prices spring back, up sharply from a deeply oversold condition: Indicator Strategy Example for Margin Debt, with Overbought/Oversold Brackets Based on a 36-year file of monthly data for Margin Debt on the New York Stock Ex- change and the DJIA since January, 1965, we found that a Overbought/Oversold Bracket Rule would have produced a positive result on a purely mechanical signal ba- sis with no subjectivity no sophisticated technical analysis, and no judgement: Enter Long (Buy) at the current month-end price close of the DJIA when the current month's annual rate of change of Margin Debt crosses from be- low _ 1% to above _ 1 %. price lays price 8 80 Sell when Margin DebtkRAc 12 crosses from above 5o% td belowv 5p%/ 70 60: 50 40 30 20 _ t0 -10 ~20 when_Malgin DebtROC 42erosses from below |1% tc above -1% 30 250000 200000 150000} 100000 50000 Margih Debt (top)  (umulative [Equity Linelfor Longs and shbrts (middle) pow-Jones IIndustria1 Average (bottom) with Buyjand Selllsignal Arrows]  Semi-Log Scale mAmmtmmcMIM MMMMMMT cheiiIttFtat cmmt MMITICUIHIAIIMTIE FIITL ATEITASTZIXITLMIALAL Ieft@fELIATTCIIFUAETIXIL:ALIHIITTITIAFTLIXIA?LUP DFTFAIMITFHetuetDO4Xe3auueaiu __ealiueTFti_Tile; iMETTNITNFtFhI!IIIAITP GTVTEILEHETMMIMI 736 667 138 69 {7o 172 173 174 175 176 178 179 80 81 182 183 [84 [85 186 187 188 [89 190 191 192 193 194 195 196 197 198 199 00 Buy Margin Debt Overbought/Oversold Bracket Rule Total net profit 2028.7 Open position value 61.51 Net Profit Buy&Hold 111.56 Percent gain/loss 2028.7 Annual percent gain/loss 58.2 Annual Net % B&H % 111.56 Initial investment 100 Interest earned Current position Short Date position entered 4/1/00 BuylHold profit 958.92 Days in test 12724 # of per trade 1817.71 Buy/Hold pct gain/loss 958.92 Annual BIH pct gainlloss 27.51 Total closed trades Commissions paid Avg profit per trade 281.03 Win/Avg Loss ratio 12.55 Total long trades Total short trades Long Win Trade % 100.00 Winning long trades Winning short trades Short Win Trade % 66.67 Total winning trades Total losing trades Total Win Trade % 85.71 Amount of winning trades 1993.65 Amount of losing trades 26.47 Net Profit Margin % 97.38 Average win 332.28 Average loss 26.47 Average P.

With the Margin Requirement at 50%, the investor is required to put down at least half of the total purchase His broker will lend him the remaining 50%, and charge him interest on it. The Federal Reserve Board Fed has kept the Margin Requirement unchanged at 50% since January 1974. So, it appears that the Fed no longer uses the Margin Re- quirement as a tool of monetary policy Between 1934 to 1974, the Fed increased the price price profit days. price. Market Profile 381 Margin Requirement 12 times and lowered it 10 times The Fed raised the Margin Re- quirement to force investors to put up more money to stock and to dampen spec- ulation. The Fed cut the Margin Requirement after significant declines in the stock market to make it easier for investors to hold and more stock. Critics of the Fed insist that the Fed should not be in the business of manipulating stock Although this indicator has been gathering dust for decades, the stock market used to react to changes in the Margin Requirement. Norman Fosback, in his 1976 book, Stock Market Logic (The Institute for Econometric Research, 3471 North Fed- eral Highway, Fort Lauderdale, FL 33306) , found that the stock market's initial reac- tion to increases in the Margin Requirement has been negative. But by the end of the first month after such an increase, the stock market recovered, 1.1% on aver- age, as measured by the Standard & Poor's 500 Index. One year after an increase, the market rose 14.4%, a rate of significantly above normal: Furthermore, Fosback discovered that the market initially declined an average of 2.39 three months after a reduction in the Margin Requirement; contrary to what one might expect: This might imply that in a bear market; the downward momentum is not quickly stemmed. But following that short-term decline, the market reversed to the upside, gaining above-average amounts of 12.59, 16.39, and 18.59, in the 12 months, 15 months, and 18 months following a Margin Requirement reduction, re- spectively. So, longer term, after an initial disappointment, cuts in the Margin Re- quirement indeed have been bullish: Market Profile Market Profile is a statistical frequency distribution of tick data designed to reveal how many trades occurred at each specific during each trading session. It re- veals the market balance or imbalance as well as precise levels of support and resis- tance on micro level When there is a significant quantity of trading activity at a specific price, that becomes established as the value in traders minds. When moves from value then returns to value, finds support Or resistance at value_ Market Profile gained dedicated following among some sophisticated short-term traders but has not attained widespread use among investors Or techni- cians.

CA 8 Chart by permission of Ned Davis Research: Buy 384 Technical Market Indicators Mathematical Models The technical indicators presented in this book are Simple mathematical models. Be- ing simple, they are easy to understand, compute, and implement: A mathematical model is simply an idealized representation of reality in the form of a clearly defined formula; o more than one formula, combined into a system. Fortunately, simple els actually work better than complex systems. If you can't understand it, don't use it: Maximum Entropy Spectral Analysis (MESA) Maximum Entropy Spectrum Analysis (MESA) Maximum Entropy Method (MEM) The names for MESA have been used interchangeably, even by the same writer: MESA, which was developed by a geophysics scientist, extracts short-term cycles us- ing adaptive algorithms to short data lengths. Short-term cycles in financial markets, which generally are irregular and always shifting, seemingly offer almost un- limited promise to anyone who could forecast them. Naturally, traders are tempted to use minimal market price data and any available technique in a wishful attempt to identify the precise junctures when cycles shift: Unfortunately, market behavior is even more irregular over shorter time frames than it is over longer And, of course, the irregular market data generated by mass psychological mood swings is not at all comparable to the regular data produced by physical phenomena, for which MESA was designed. Therefore, the application of MESA to market data is questionable. MESA is based on the Burg algorithm. (See the Ph.D. thesis by John Parker Stanford University, 1975.) Burg pioneered high-resolution spectral estimation from limited time sequences, using minimal data. Burg' s ideas caught the imagination of traders and analysts. In 1978, John Ehlers, an aerospace signals engineer; was the first to write a software program to use MESA on market data. On Ehlers' website, WWWmesasoftware.com; he writes that his MESA2OOO program employs adaptive filters and feedback loops to adjust to changing cycles. The output of the filter is compared with the samples of actual mar- ket price data, and the result of the comparison is repeatedly fed back to adjust the fil- ter so that the filter output moves toward the observed data. A fraction of yesterday' $ dominant is today' $ data length, and the filter parameters are fixed by the price data. The adaptive data length avoids measurement latency, Or usually produced by a fixed length data window. Ehlers has written that it is not sound method to trade based solely o cycles, because tradable are present only about 15% of the time. A sound trading strategy must incorporate trend-following techniques, such as moving averages. mod- applied periods. Burg; price cycle lag; cycles McClellan Oscillator 385 (See "Cycle Measurements, Technical Analysis of Stocks Commodities; Vol. 15:11, pp. 505-509, www.traders_com.) Perry Kaufman has suggested that optimized cycles based on a small amount of data must have low reliability: (See Kaufman on Commodity Trading;' Technical Analysis of Stocks & Commodities, Vol. 6.4, pp. 123-128, Www.traders.com:) According to Jeffrey Katz and Donna McCormick; The Encyclopedia of Trad- ing Strategies, McGraw Hill, New York; 2000, 376 pages, page 203-4, 'Anumber of problems, however; exist with the maximum entropy method, as well as with other mathematical methods for determining MEM, for example, is somewhat finicky. It can be extremely sensitive to small changes in the data or in such parame- ters as the number of poles and the look-back period. In addition, the data must not only be de-trended or differenced, but also it must be passed through a low-pass filter for smoothing before the data can be handed to the maximum entropy algo- rithm; the algorithm does not work very well on raw data. The problem with passing the data through a filter; prior to the maximum entropy cycle extraction, is that lag and phase shifts are induced. Consequently, extrapolations of the cycles de- tected can be incorrect in terms of phase and timing unless additional analyses are employed ' Katz and McCormick conclude their Chapter 10, "Cycle-Based Entries" with the following observation: The markets appear to have become more efficient rela- tive to models Obvious market behavior (such as clear; tradable cycles) are traded away before most traders can capitalize on them.

Subtract the number of declining issues from the number of advancing issues each and respect the sign (so that more declines than advances will be a negative number). 2_ Smooth this daily advance-decline difference with two different exponential moving averages (EMAs), a 19-day EMA and a 39-day EMA 3. Subtract the 39-day EMA from the 19-day EMA. The resulting plot of the McClellan Oscillator oscillates around zero. Like other momentum oscillators, the McClellan Oscillator sometimes reaches an extreme ing before a change in the trend of stock prices NYSE data is usually used, though data for other exchanges could be used also. many cycles. price noisy; cycle day; read- 386 Technical Market Indicators Traditionally, the McClellan Oscillator was thought to signal overbought and oversold general market conditions A bear market selling climax or bull market buying climax was thought to be indicated by extreme oscillator readings As the fol- lowing chart shows, however; levels have been shifting to greater extremes over time, due to the large increase in the number of total issues listed on the stock exchange. Therefore, McClellan Oscillator ought to be adjusted for this increase by, for exam- ple, dividing the daily net advances by total issues traded: When the McClellan Oscillator moves from below zero to above zero, it signals change to positive momentum, and that is a bullish sign for stock in the near future. When the McClellan Oscillator moves from above zero to below zero, that is bearish for the stock market. A detailed description of how to interpret the McClellan Oscillator is included in Patterns for Profit: The McClellan Oscillator and Summation Index; (Trade Lev- els, 22801 Ventura Boulevard, Suite 210, Woodland Hills, CA 91364).

The Or direction of the McClellan Summa- tion Index; or falling, is a 99-times better indicator than crossing any level. This indicator is the equivalent of the McClellan Oscillator; since the Oscillator crosses zero when the Summation changes direction. Based on a 68-year file of daily data for the number of shares advancing and de- clining each on the NYSE and the DJIA since March &, 1932, we found that the following simple trend-following rule would have produced a profitable result on a purely mechanical signal basis with no subjectivity no sophisticated technical analy- sis, and no judgement: Enter (Buy) at the current daily price close of the DJIA when the McClellan Summation Index   changes direction from downward to upward. Close Long (Sell) at the current daily close of the DJIA when the McClellan Summation Index   changes direction from   upward to downward. Enter Short (Sell Short) at the current daily close of the DJIA when the McClellan Summation Index changes direction from upward to downward. Close Short (Cover) at the current daily close of the DJIA when the McClellan Summation Index changes direction from downward to upward: Starting with $100 and reinvesting profits, total net profits for the McClellan Summation Index Direction trend-following strategy would have been S906,443.88, assuming fully invested strategy, reinvestment of profits, no transactions costs and no taxes.

Merrill, CMT; compares the behavior of savvy professional traders to the little guy, the small-timer who can only afford to place orders of less than a round-lot of 100 shares_ Starting with the raw weekly data published in Barron $, in a complex series of basically simple calculations, Merrill manipulates the raw data to produce a smoothed ratio. Merrill's sentiment indicator may be calculated and interpreted in 9 1. Multiply member purchases by odd lot sales. 2_ Multiply that product (from 1) by 100. Save this product for 6_ 3. Add odd lot purchases to odd lot sales. 4 Subtract that sum (from 3) from member sales. 5_ Multiply that difference (from Step 4) by odd lot purchases. 6.

This result was probably significant statistically: Market behavior over the next one, five, 13, and 52 weeks was insignif- icant; however: Member Short Ratio Late Friday, after the close, the NYSE releases summary statistics on the total volume of short sales. Short sales by stock exchange members are separated from short sales by nonmembers (the public) Because the absolute levels of short selling have increased in all categories with the general expansion in the total volume of trading activity, the data must be normalized somehow hence the various short sales ratios_ The Member Short Ratio is computed by dividing total member short sales by total short sales. In theory, members, who are usually seasoned professional traders highly experienced in the ways of the market; are generally right about the trend of stock prices. If not; won t be able to stay in business. When the Member Short Ratio is high, members are shorting heavily relative to the public This indicates smart money prOS are pessimistic, and this is a bearish indi- cator for the future trend of stock Similarly; low Member Short Ratio is bullish: The smart money pros are rela- tively optimistic. Thus, this indicator is interpreted in a manner similar to an Over- bought/Oversold Oscillator: Short Selling is an aggressive trading strategy designed to take advantage of de- clining prices. Speculators may sell short a stock when anticipate a decline. If the stock does may realize a equal to the difference between their sell-short and the lower buy-back If are and the stock rises, their loss will equal the amount of the stock price appreciation, O the difference be- tween their sell price and the higher buy-back Indicator Strategy Example for Member Short Ratio Based on a 55-year file of Member Short Ratios and weekly closing data for the DJIA from January 1946 to December 2000, we found that the following parameters would have produced a positive result on purely mechanical overboughtloversold Step Step lower Step Using period along they prices. they price drop; they profit , price price. they wrong price. price 8 Member SS, Envelopes +- 10% Equity (5,320} 5000 Cumulative Equity Line for Longs Only Semi-Log Scale V(5,489) 9500 90o0 8500 Member Short Ratio 5000 (Member Shorts Total Shorts) 1000 4500 4000 1C000 5000 Dow-Jones Industrial Average Weekly Price Close Semi-Log Scale '1940 '1950" 11960 61970 '1980 1t990 boo h Member Short Ratio (Envelope) Total net profit 5220.29 Open position value NJA Net Profit Buy&Hold 0.05 Percent gain/loss 5220.29 Annual percent gain/loss 94.94 Annual Net % B&H % 0.05 Initial investment 100 Interest earned Current position Out Date position entered 11/12/99 BuylHold profit 5217.78 Days in test 20070 # of per trade 329.02 Buy/Hold pct gain/loss 5217.78 Annual BIH pct gainlloss 94.89 Total closed trades 61 Commissions paid Avg profit per trade 85.58 Win/Avg Loss ratio 7.16 Total long trades 61 Total short trades Long Win Trade % 80.33 Winning long trades 49 Winning short trades Short Win Trade % #DIVIO!

It is essentially the same indicator as Rate-of-Change (ROC) Momentum can be de- fined as difference or ratio, with the ratio method much preferable in order to maintain comparability over time. The ratio method of calculating momentum can be expressed as follows: Momentum = (C / Cn 100 where C is the most recent closing price, and Cn is the closing n periods ago. price buy ,opt] , price price Momentum 401 In the Equis MetaStock Indicator Builder syntax, the popular 10-period mo- mentum is represented as: Momentum (C/Ref(C,-10))100 where C is the most recent closing price, and Ref(C,-10) is the closing 10 ods ago. This formula produces a momentum ratio that fluctuates around 100.00. (Some analysts seem to to subtract 100 so that the indicator fluctuates around zero.) Momentum indicators are subject to irrelevant random noise when data outliers suddenly drop out of the moving time window O which the calculations are based, and for this reason we prefer other formulations of the same basic concept: Trend followers when the momentum indicator: bottoms and turns up, crosses above some absolute threshold, crosses above some moving average of itself, shows some positive divergence relative to Sell when the opposite conditions apply. If the momentum indicator reaches extremely high or low values (relative to its historical values), it may imply a continuation of the current trend. For example, if the momentum indicator reaches extremely high levels that means the trend is un- usually strong and, therefore, price could trend still higher: Divergences between momentum and price can be a leading indicator: As prices enter an important Reversal Pattern, Or distribution phase, momentum begins to deteriorate as the advance slows. Similarly, at a market bottom, momentum often sta- bilizes before The basic momentum concept is central to technical analysis. The velocity of movement is a leading indicator of a change in trend direction: Momentum pre- cedes In a typical major market cycle, begins a new uptrend with very high and momentum. This positive velocity gradually diminishes as be- come fully valued, as buyers back away somewhat; and as sellers increase the supply of stock offered. The slope of the advance lessens. Almost invariably, momen- tum hits its peak well before the price hits its ultimate high. Momentum tapers off fur- ther as price  begins to make little   further  upward progress on rally  attempts Momentum decreases more dramatically as rallies begin to fall short of previ- ous peaks on minor rally attempts, depicting a very mature phase of bullish exhaus- tion. Suddenly, momentum breaks sharply into negative territory as price drops below previous minor lows, giving sell signals to chart readers. A new Market (the downward phase of the full cycle) has begun. Eventually, after a long decline, price velocity typically bottoms out before price hits its ultimate low. When margin accounts are liquidated and prices become cheap, O excessively undervalued, new buyers are attracted to tentatively bid for stocks in an atmosphere where sellers are price peri- prefer buy price. price Top price. price price. price rising prices price price Bear long 402 Technical Market Indicators already exhausted. As downward momentum becomes less negative on subsequent minor price declines, and as the negative rate of price change diminishes, the stage is set for a new upward cycle, which is clearly signaled when price breaks out to the up- side of a chart bottom pattern on the best momentum seen since the last Bull Market: (See Rate-of-Change ROC) for an Indicator Strategy Example.)

Merrill, CMT; found that not all months of the year have been equally re- warding, and he proved it in his classic book, Behavior of Prices on Wall Street; Sec- ond Edition, The Analysis Press; Chappaqua; New York; 1984, 147 pages Using the calendar and price changes for the DJIA, he counted the number of times the market rose or fell for each month of the year over an 87-year period, from 1897 to 1983. Eight of the 12 months saw higher stock most of the time. The market rose 55.5% of the time in the average month: The best months were December (rising 68% of the time), August (rising 67% of the time), and January (rising 64.39 of the time). November; July, March, and April were in that order; 58.89 to 57.1% of the time. October was be- low average, up only 51.69 of the time. The worst months were September (rising 44.3% of the time), June (rising 44.9% of the time), February (rising 46.9% of the time), and (rising 48.0% of the time). We duplicated and updated Merrill's study using 101 years of month-end clos- prices for the DJIA, from 1900 through 2000. Our findings closely match Mer- rill s. For the frequency of winning months of the year; the top three months are still December; August and January: The worst months are still September; February; and June_ There have been some small shifts since Merrill's study 17 years ago. Thanks to the great bullish stock market uptrend over that time period, Our most recent data shows that over the past century the average month rose 56.6% of the time, up from 55.59 in Merrill's study.

Indeed, historical data shows that a strategy based on this insight alone can produce positive results, on both the side and the short side. Based on the month-end closing prices the DJIA for the past 100 years, we found that the following parameters would have produced a positive result on a purely mechanical trend-following signal basis with no subjectivity, no sophisticated technical analysis, and no judgement: Enter Long (Buy) at the month end close of the DJIA every year on the last trading day of September: Close Long (Sell) at the month end close of the DJIA every on the last trading day of August: Enter Short (Sell Short) at the month end price close of the DJIA every year on the last trading of August. Close Short (Cover) at the month end price close of the DJIA every year on the last trading day of September: Starting with $100 and reinvesting profits, total net profits, and short, for this seasonal strategy would have been $164,048.25, assuming a fully invested strat- egy, reinvestment of profits, no transactions costs and no taxes.

There have been many versions of the basic concept over the decades. Ned Davis Research has developed a version that would have been highly accurate and would have out- performed the market substantially on the long side. It is calculated and interpreted in eight steps. 1. Using daily data for the NYSE 15 most actively traded stocks, count the net number of advances minus declines each (the number that rose minus the number that fell). Note that when a greater number of stocks decline than advance, the net is a negative number; and we retain that negative sign. 2_ daily data for the ASE 10 most actively traded stocks, count a similar net number of most active advances minus declines each 3_ Add the daily nets of the NYSE and ASE: 4 Calculate a 10-day moving total of the combined NYSE and ASE total. 5. Draw two standard deviation brackets (see Bollinger Bands), one above and one below this 10-day moving total. 6_ when the 10-day moving total crosses the lower bracket from below to above, thus, moving out of the oversold zone. 7_ Sell when the 10-day moving total crosses the upper bracket from above to below, thus, moving out of the overbought zone. 8_ Add a protective stop-loss: sell when the New York Stock Exchange Com- posite Stock Price Index falls 69 below its level at the time of the latest signal: day; Using day: Buy buy Daily Daia 970571990 873072001 (Log Scale) New York Stock Exchange Composite 726 Profitable Long Trades: 81 % +SS 726 666 Gain/Annum 13.8 % 666 6 1 1 Buy-Hold Gain} Annum: 10.6 % 611 560 Latest Signal 8/20/2001 603.17 sl 560 Be B[ 513 S = Switch into CommercialPaper 513 471 Signal Dates: 6/1841982 8/30/2001 a8 471 431 Drawdown Stop-Loss 6 % BB 431 396 396 363 GPA on Buys 21.9 % 5 363 332 Time on 46.8 % 332 305 98 M1 305 279 BB 279 256 B8 256 235 235 215 1 B 8 Oversold signals generated when 10-day most actives 215 197 indicator rises above lower bracket _ 197 8  BB Overbought sell (switch to commercial paper) signals generated 181 when 10-day most actives indicator falls below upper bracket 181 166 A sell signal will also be flashed if the NYSE Composite falls 166 152 6 % below the signal level; 152 Br Brr M ] $ D M 5 D M ] S D M ] D M ] D M ] $ D M D M J $ D M D M D M 199 1992 1993 1994 995 1996 1991 1998 1999 2000 2001 Number of Advancing Most Active Stocks Minus 100 Number of Declining Most Active Stocks (10-Day Total) Overbought 100 80 80 60 60 40 40 20 20 20 20 40 -40 -60 60 Oversold -80 -80 100 -100 (S269) 10-Day_Most_Actives_on NYSE (15 Stocks) and AMEX (10 Stocks) : Chart by permission of Ned Davis Research: B B for Buys 1 ^ buy buy 412 Technical Market Indicators Moving Average Convergence-Divergence Trading Method (MACD) The Moving Average Convergence-Divergence   Trading Method (MACD or MACDTM) is a price momentum oscillator developed by Gerald Appel, publisher of Systems and Forecasts, Signalert Corporation, 150 Great Neck Road, Great Neck; NY 11021, (516) 829-6444. MACD is calculated in three steps: 1. Calculate the spread difference between two Exponential Moving Av- erages (EMA) of the closing slower; 26-day EMA (using a smooth- constant of .075) is subtracted from faster 12-day EMA (using smoothing constant of 0.15). Plot this differential oscillator; which measures velocity 2_ Smooth this velocity with an even faster 9-day EMA with a smoothing constant of 0.2). Plot this signal line. 3_ Calculate a second differential oscillator by subtracting the signal line from the price velocity: Plot this measure of price acceleration as a histogram: Appel sometimes uses different lengths for the EMAs, depending on the behav- ior of the security and trading objectives, shorter or longer term. He also analyses longer-term perspectives weekly data, based only on the closing price for the last day of each week. Appel has shown that his basic MACD concept is adaptable to any time-frame_ Appel does not advocate simple mechanical rule for interpreting MACD. Rather; Appel has published proprietary decision rules he offers for sale in a research report and video tape. Indicator Strategy Example for MACD MACD requires experience and judgement to use as Appel intended. Even naive test- assumptions suggest that MACD may have some objective potential value as a purely mechanical, trend-following technical indicator: The majority of monthly signals would have been profitable, for trades only. MACD would have slightly outperformed the passive buy-and-hold strategy for trades only; while short sell- would not have been profitable. Based on a 72-year file of month-end closing price data for the DJIA from 11/28 to 12/00, we found that the following parameters would have produced a positive re- sult on a purely mechanical trend-following signal basis with no subjectivity, no s0- phisticated technical analysis, and no judgement: point price: ing price price using ing buy long long ing Moving Average Convergence-Divergence Trading Method (MACD) 413 Enter Long (Buy) at the current month-end price close of the DJIA when the MACD (the 12-month EMA minus the 26-month EMA) crosses above its own Signal Line (the 9-month EMA of the difference between the 12- month EMA minus the 26-month EMA). Close Long (Sell) at the current month-end price close of the DJIA when the MACD (the 12-month EMA minus the 26-month EMA) crosses below its own Signal Line (the 9-month EMA of the difference between the 12- month EMA minus the 26-month EMA). Enter Short (Sell Short) never: Starting with S100 and reinvesting profits, total net profits for this MACD trend-following strategy would have been $3,586.55,assuming a fully invested strat- egy, reinvestment of profits, no transactions costs and no taxes. This would have been 0.99 percent greater than buy-and-hold: No short selling would have been profitable, and no short selling was included in the strategy. Short selling would have cut the by 84%, to much less than buy-and-hold. Long-only MACD as an indicator would have given profitable signals 58.62% of the time. would have been extremely inactive at one trade every 907.14 calendar days. Note that this strat- egy considers month-end closing only while ignoring everything in between.

These reduce the trading frequency compared to using any one moving average alone. For example, using just two different moving averages, one short-term and one long-term, when is above the short-term moving average and is above the long-term moving average; and sell when price is below the short-term moving aver- age and is below the long-term moving average. A very different result is obtained when we substitute the word or for and in the decision rule above. Trading frequency is much higher for or than for and Moving Average Oscillators See Price Oscillator:_ Moving Average Slope The Moving Average Slope subtracts the moving average level n-periods ago from the current moving average level. For example, & recent magazine article referred to slope as the 80-day simple moving average of the daily closing minus the level of the same 80-day simple moving average 10-days previous. We have tried all the many variations on this theme, and we prefer the moving average crossover because it is more effective. Some people fool themselves by using different indicators that are, in effect; the exact equivalent of one another: For example, it is curious to note that an exponential moving average changes slope from down to up or from Up to down at the same time that the close crosses the exponential moving average. An simple moving average changes slope from down to up or from up to down at the same time that an rate of change crosses zero. An n-period weighted moving average changes from down to up or from up to down at the same time that the close crosses simple moving average of length n-1 periods. Seemingly different indicators some- times produce the same results_ Watch out for multicolinearity: Multicolinearity John Bollinger; CFA, CMT; has correctly pointed out that multicolinearity is the dan- gerous illusion of weighing the same basic information in slightly different forms, Moving buy price price n-period n-period slope Multiple Time Frame Analysis Using Exponential Moving Average Crossover Rules 417 while erroneously expecting independent verification. Smart analysts avoid this trap. Note that using several different momentum indicators derived from the same series of closing prices over the same time period to confirm each other is not correct inde- pendent verification, instead it is counting the same several times. For example, combining RSI, Stochastics, MACD, Momentum; and Rate-of-Change is not the same as weighing different independent indicators, since are all based on closing velocity: To avoid this an analyst could choose one indicator derived from closing prices, another from volume, another from range, another from relative strength (not RSI), another from sentiment, and perhaps even another from a different market; such as interest-rates in a stock model. A variety of time-frames, either short; in- termediate, or may also add a valuable cross-check to the analysis. Multiple Time Frame Analysis Using Exponential Moving Average Crossover Rules Perhaps  the most widely used technical  indicator of all is the moving average crossover rule: when the daily price close crosses above the moving average sell when the daily price close crosses under the moving average. This strategy pre- dates computers and electronic calculators. It is probably no coincidence that the tra- ditional moving average lengths are based on the number ten: 10 months (about 200 trading days), 10 weeks (about 50 trading days), and 10 It takes scant comput- power to add together 10 numbers, then divide that sum by 10, which involves simply shifting the decimal one place to the left: These specific lengths are well established in technical analysis literature and the media, So criticisms of hindsight curve fitting do not apply: (For a 65-year old reference citing these specific moving average lengths, see Gartley, H. Profits in the Stock Market, Lambert- Gann Publishing Co-, Box 0, Pomeroy WA. 1935.) The use of three moving averages works well with the ancient (more than a cen- tury old) technical analysis approach of multiple time frame analysis for determining trends of three degrees. Borrowing the language of Charles Dow'$ Start with the long-term, Primary Tide, which is fairly effectively captured by the 200-day moving average. Next; narrow your focus to the intermediate-term, Secondary Wave, which is captured by the 50-day moving average. Finally, fine tune with the short-term; Minor Ripple, captured by the 10-day moving average. thing they price trap; price using long and buy days. ing point  popular M:; theory; 418 Technical Market Indicators The decision rules for risk-averse maximization are clear and unambiguous: when the daily price close crosses above all three moving averages; sell when the daily price close crosses under any of the three moving averages; sell short when the daily close crosses under all three moving averages; cover short when the daily close crosses above any of the three mov- averages_ Indicator Strategy Example for Multiple Time Frame Exponential Moving Averages To be consistent with OUr general testing protocol in this book, substituted expo- nential moving averages the more traditional simple moving averages of equiva- lent length. Also, we compared today's close with yesterday'$ exponential moving averages to recognize our trading signals (since we can t trade today based on a mov- ing average we can 't calculate yet because we don't yet have today' $ closing price) These small refinements not only offer greater realism in historical simulation, but also improve the performance of most systems by reducing the well-known lag-time associated with moving averages. Historical data shows that this multiple time frame analysis for determining trends of three degrees outperformed the passive buy-and-hold strategy by an ex- tremely large margin, more than 144 fold. Based on the daily closing for the DJIA for 101 years from 1900 to 2001, found that the following parameters would have produced results on a purely mechanical trend-following signal basis with no subjectivity, no sophisticated technical analysis, and no judgement: Enter Long (Buy) at the current daily close of the DJIA when that daily close is above all three exponential moving averages, specifically the 10-day, 50-day, and 200-day exponential moving averages of the daily closing Close (Sell) at the current daily price close of the DJIA when that daily close is below any of the three exponential moving averages, ically the 10-day, 50-day, or 200-day exponential moving averages of the daily closing price.

This would have been 14,324.15 percent greater than buy-and-hold. Short selling would have been profitable, although not since 1987, and short selling was included in the strategy: Long and short signals together would have given profitable signals only 35.759 of the time, but winning trades were than losing trades. Trading would have been extremely active at one trade every 15.03 calendar The Equis International MetaStock System Testing rules are written as follows: Enter CLOSE > Ref(Mov(CLOSE,optl,E),-1) AND CLOSE > Ref(Mov(CLOSE,opt2,E),-1) AND CLOSE Ref(Mov(CLOSE,opt3,E),-1) Close CLOSE Ref(Mov(CLOSE,optl,E),-1) OR CLOSE Ref(Mov(CLOSE,opt2,E),-1) OR CLOSE Ref(Mov(CLOSE,opt3,E),-1) Enter short: CLOSE Ref(Mov(CLOSE,optl,E)-1) AND CLOSE Ref(Mov(CLOSE,opt2,E),-1) AND CLOSE Ref(Mov(CLOSE,opt3,E),-1) Close short: CLOSE > Ref(Mov(CLOSE,optl,E),-1) OR CLOSE > Ref(Mov(CLOSE,opt2,E),-1) OR CLOSE > Ref(Mov(CLOSE,opt3,E),-1) OPTI Current value: 10 OPT2 Current value: 50 OPT3 Current value: 200 price specif- price. larger - days. long: long: 8 AOOOOO 300000 200000 100000 Cumulative Equity Line MULTIPLE TIME FRAME ANALYSIS Semi-Log Scale Cumulative Equity Line Dow-Jones Industrial Average Daily Price Close Semi-Log Scale k1o 1900 1910 1920 '1930 1940 1950 1960 11970 1980 1990 2C Multiple Time Frame Analysis Total net profit 3189323.5 Open position value NJA Net Profit Buy&Hold % 14324.15 Percent gain/loss 3189323.5 Annual percent gain/loss 31435.06 Annual Net % B&H % 14324.38 Initial investment 100 Interest earned Current position Out Date position entered 5/23/01 Buy/Hold profit 22111 in test 37032 #of days per trade 15.03 BuylHold pct gain/loss 22111 Annual BIH pct gain/loss 217.93 Total closed trades 2464 Commissions paid profit per trade 1294.37 Avg Win/Avg Loss ratio 2.35 { Total long trades 1520 Total short trades 944 Long Win Trade % 38.36 Winning long trades 583 Winning short trades 298 Short Win Trade % 31.57 3 Total winning trades 881 Total losing trades 1583 Total Win Trade % 35.75 3 Amount of winning trades 13597166 Amount of losing trades 10407845 Net Profit Margin % 13.29 Average win 15433.79 Average loss 6574.76 Average P Margin % 40.25 Largest win 450190.5 Largest loss 191684.75 % Net (Win + Loss) 40.27 1 Average length of win 15 Average length of loss 3.93 (Win Loss) / Loss % 281.68 Longest winning trade 63 Longest losing trade 24 (Win Loss 1 Loss % 162.50 5 Most consecutive wins Most consecutive losses 11 (Win Loss) / Loss % 36.36 Total bars out 13214 Average length out 5.51 1 Longest out period 202 System close drawdown -1.6 Profit/Loss index 23.46 % Net Profit SODD 199332718.75 System open drawdown 1.6 Reward/Risk index 100 (Net P-SODD)Net P 100.00 Max open trade drawdown 191684.75 Buy/Hold index 14324.15 % SODD Net Profit 0.00 In the Equis MetaStocke "System Report" (profit and loss summary statistics) , the Total net is the sum of profits minus the sum of losses, including open positions marked to the market: In contrast, the Amount of Winning Trades is the sum of realized profits (the total of all on closed-out trades only, excluding any open positions).

Each month; the Investment Com- pany Institute (1775 K Street; N.W,, Washington, DC 20006) reports detailed statis- tics 0n the portfolio holdings of mutual funds The Mutual Funds Cash/Assets Ratio may be viewed as sample of available buying power for the general stock market. Mutual Fund portfolio managers are sim- ilar to the broader universe of all professional money managers When their Cash/As- sets Ratio is relatively high as compared to historical norms, then relatively more cash is available to buy stocks, and that is potential fuel for a bullish trend, other things be- equal. But when their Cash/Assets Ratio is relatively low, then relatively little cash is left to stocks or support prices, so the market may be vulnerable to a de- cline, other equal. It is important to note, however; that, other things are not always equal, and sentiment indicators should be used only as supplements to more precise technical timing indicators. As the chart of Stock Mutual Funds Cash/Assets Ratio by Ned Davis Research shows, the S&P 500 has made strong of 20.1% per annum after cash rose above 9.59 of assets. In contrast, S&P 500 were only 2.1% per annum after cash fell to 6.9% of assets.

Sell when the current price low falls below the previous n days' lowest price low. This is simply another name for the Price Channel Trading Range Breakout Rule. (See Price Channel Trading Range Breakout Rule.) Negative Volume Index (NVI) The Negative Volume Index, created by Paul Dysart, cumulates net price change for periods of declining volume only: The idea is that mainly smart professional traders and sell during relatively periods of declining volume. In contrast, unpro- fessional, emotionally driven players are active on days when volume rises There- fore, market activity on days when a negative change in volume occurs should better reflect the thinking of the smart-money professionals who treat trading as a serious business rather than as some wild casino game. NVI may be calculated for any time interval, such as minutes, hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly. Moreover; NVI may be calculated any market index, stock or commodity, as as there is data for closing and volume. The volume itself is used only as qualifier to determine whether Or not to include the S net price change fractional ratio in the cumulative total. If volume today is less than vol- ume yesterday, then today'$ net price change fractional ratio is included in the cumu- lative total. But if the volume today is greater than the volume of the previous then today' $ net price change fractional ratio is not included in the cumulative total. Thus, NVI is defined as a cumulative total of daily change fractional ratios for declining volume days only: To calculate the Negative Volume Index, compare the current day' $ volume to the previous day'$ volume. If today' $ volume is greater than yesterday'$ volume, then does not qualify as a Negative Volume therefore today' $ net change is assumed to be zero and the Negative Volume Index remains unchanged at yester- day's level. But; if today's volume is less than yesterday' $ volume, today does ify as Negative Volume Then, divide the current day $ net change (respecting the sign, plus for a net gain, Or minus for a net loss; by the closing yesterday to arrive at today'$ net change fractional ratio. Finally, add today' $ plus or minus net change fractional ratio to cumulative total to arrive at the Negative Volume Index: Thus, NVI rises on days of positive price change on lower volume, NVI falls on of negative price change on volume, and NVI is unchanged on days of higher volume no matter what the price action. buy buy quiet using long price day" day; price today day; price qual- day: price we price price we price days lower Negativve Volume Index (NVI) 425 In MetaStock@ s Indicator Builder dialogue, NVI may be expressed by the following: Cum(If(V<Ref(V-1),ROC(C,1,%),0)) The step-by-step literal translation is: "Cumulate the following: If the current volume is less than the previous period'$ volume, then compute the Rate-of-Change of the Closing price for one period, expressed as percentage; otherwise (if the cur- rent volume is greater than the previous volume), set the day' s Rate-of-Change of the Closing price to zero before cumulating:' Norman Fosback (The Institute for Econometric Research; 3471 North Federal Highway, Forth Lauderdale, FL 33306) found that when NVI was above its own trail- moving average, that indicated positive returns for the stock market: Our inde- pendent testing confirmed this across all moving average period lengths (see below) Indicator Strategy Example for the Negative Volume Index (NVI) Historical data shows that the Negative Volume Index produces a modestly positive result on the long side. NVI under performed the buy-and-hold strategy because of heavy long-side losses from 1929 to 1933. Short selling strategies all lost money: Based on the number of shares traded each on the NYSE and the daily prices for the DJIA for 72 years from 1928 to 2000, we found that the following parameters would have produced a positive result on a purely mechanical trend-following signal basis with no subjectivity, no sophisticated technical analysis, and no judgement: Enter Long (Buy) at the current daily price close of the DJIA when the current Negative Volume Index is greater than the previous day'$ Negative Volume Index. Close Long (Sell) at the current daily close of the DJIA when the current Negative Volume Index is less than the previous day's Negative Volume Index. Enter Short (Sell Short) never Starting with S1O0 and reinvesting profits, total net profits for this Negative Vol- ume Index strategy would have been $3,096.88, assuming a fully invested strategy, reinvestment of profits, no transactions costs and no taxes. This would have been 32.31 percent less than buy-and-hold. Only about 46.27 percent of the 2213 signals would have produced winning trades, and the average trade lasted 11.87 trading days on average.

Our studies strongly suggest that daily data is more useful than weekly data trading, so we limited our examples here to daily data only: Many technicians collect New Highs-New Lows data separately on weekly basis for a long-term perspective, and such weekly indicators produce different results with fewer signals. Note that although a simple subtraction of New Lows from New Highs has been the more method, the difference between New Highs and New Lows is properly expressed as percentage of Total Issues Traded each on the NYSE: That stock exchange has promoted new business rather effectively, and so Total Is- sues Traded have increased 71 % from 1971 issues on 29, 1984, to 3371 issues on July 12, 2000. This adjustment is particularly important when comparing indica- tor levels over time. Without this normalization, the simple difference goes to great extremes as time goes by, simply because there are more stocks eligible for counting: This differencelratio method preserves the comparability of data over time by auto- matically adjusting for the ever increasing number of stocks traded on the exchange. Thus, the levels on the chart remain comparable over the years. We show chart of this differencelratio in the next topic. long: long: price price price price for long popular day May New Highs-New Lows 429 Also note that the method of counting New Highs and New Lows changed in early 1978. Since then, New Highs and New Lows are reported as the number of stock issues reaching new high and new price low extremes over a trailing 52- week look-back period. Prior to 1978, the trailing look-back period varied from 2.5 to 14.5 months, according to the following arbitrary rule: for a date between January 1 and mid-March of any given a new high or new low was based on look-back period from January 1 of the previous year to the current date; but for dates after mid- March; a new high or new low was based on a look-back period from January 1 of the current year to the current date. Theoretically, this inconsistent treatment destroyed proper comparability of the data. But for practical purposes of generating buy and sell signals, the data was useful as a market indicator both before and after the date of method change in early 1978. So, most technicians simply ignore this detail, as we do here in our testing: Indicator Strategy Example of New Highs minus New Lows Based on a 60-year file of daily data for the number of New Highs minus the number of New Lows and the DJIA since 1940, we found that the simplest possible trend-fol- lowing rule would have produced a positive result on a purely mechanical signal ba- sis with no subjectivity, no sophisticated technical analysis, and no judgement: Enter Long (Buy) at the current daily price close of the DJIA when the number of New Highs minus the number of New Lows crosses above zero. Close Long (Sell) at the current daily close of the DJIA when the number of New Highs minus the number of New Lows crosses below zero_ Enter Short (Sell Short) at the current daily close of the DJIA when the number of New Highs minus the number of New Lows crosses below zero. Close Short (Cover) at the current daily price close of the DJIA when the number of New Highs minus the number of New Lows crosses above zero. Starting with $1O0 and reinvesting profits, total net profits for this New Highs Lows trend-following strategy would have been $77,520.91, assuming a invested strategy; reinvestment of profits, no transactions costs and no taxes. This would have been 960.51 percent better than buy-and-hold.

This means that the absolute difference between New Highs and New Lows increases over time, given constant market volatility The ratio of the net difference of New Highs minus New Lows divided by the Total Issues Traded each day is plotted in the chart: The ratio normalizes the data and preserves the compara- bility of data over time by automatically adjusting the ever increasing number of stocks traded: The levels on the chart remain comparable over the years. Without this adjustment, the data goes to ever greater extremes as time goes by, simply because there are more stocks eligible for counting; and that may result in a distortion of the meaning of the indicator over time Note that we cannot simply divide New Highs by New Lows because some- times New Lows are zero, and division by zero is undefined: Therefore, the best way to normalize the data is to divide the net difference by Total Issues Traded. Indicator Strategy Example of (New Highs New Lows) Total Issues Traded Based on 60-year file of daily data for the ratio of (New Highs New Lows) To- tal Issues Traded and the DJIA since 1940, we found that this ratio normalization permitted greater analytical flexibility than a simple subtraction. We multiplied the ra- tio by 1000 to make the numbers visually comparable to the simple subtraction.

But if the ratio of New Highs Total Issues Traded is low and falling, the demand for stocks is weak and growing less intense, and that is bearish: The chart shows the ra- tio multiplied by 10,000 to avoid decimals. New Highs are the sum of only those stocks on the move to new upward price extremes relative to their trailing I-year trading ranges In other words, New Highs are the total number of stock issues (listed on predefined stock exchange) attaining their highest intraday relative to their own most recent past 52-week moving windows of time, that is, relative to the most recent 1-year look-back period. Daily data is published in many financial newspapers and electronic sources for New Highs and New Lows on three separate U.S. stock exchanges: New York, Amer- ican, and NASDAQ.

Avg during - The 440 Technical Market Indicators New Issue Thermometer (IPO Monthly Total) issue stock sales are initial public stock offerings by corporations without a pre- viously existing public market for their stock  Such sales raise capital for future growth: Also, corporate officers may feel that the time is right to take advantage of generally overvalued stock market prices. When founders and other insiders offer considerable amount of new issue stock; may feel that the time is right to cash out: This indicator was developed by Norman Fosback, noted market analyst at the Institute for Econometric Research: Ned Davis Research found that a up in initial public stock offerings from a low level of 27 to an extremely high level of 62 has been followed by below-aver- age stock market returns and has preceded some major market declines, as the chart shows. The sell signal in late 1995 appears a bit more than premature, possibly be- cause there are a greater number of corporations than in the past: Thus, this data may need to be statistically normalized relative to the number of companies.

Short selling would have been unprofitable and is not included in this strategy. Most of the long trades, 57.89%, would have been profitable, and Cumulative Equity Line DrawDowns would have been very well contained. One might ask; if it underperforms buy-and-hold, why use it? The answer is because, with 50% margin, this strategy would have utperformed buy-and-hold and still have had more moderate Cumulative Equity Line DrawDowns. Trading would have been inactive with one trade every 356.11 calendar days. tend Days; Days May price Long Daily Data 1702/1969 873072001 (Log Scale) Dow_Industrials_vs 9 to_ 1 Up Days 11602 11602 10704 Average Gain After Signal: 10704 9875 23 Later 1.6% 9875 9140 69 Days Later 4,5% 9110 8404 126 Days Later % 8404 7754 7754 7153 7153 6599 6599 6088 Average Gain Atter Second 9 to Up-Day Occurrence 6088 Within a 3-Month Period: 5616 5616 5181 (With No Intervening 9 to Down Day) 5181 23 Days Later 4.5% 4780 4780 4410 69 Days Later 3.5% 4410 4068 126 Days Later 15.0% 4068 Up Arrows 3753 Daily Upside Volume 3753 3463 More Than 9 Times 3463 3195 Daily Downside Volume 3195 2947 2947 2719 2719 2508 2508 2314 2314 2135 2135 1969 1969 1817 1817 1676 TE B 1676 1546 1546 1427 1427 1316 Arrows with B 1316 1214 Second 9 to Up-Day Occurrence 1214 1120 Within a 3-Month Period 1120 1033 (With No Intervening 9 to 1 Down Day) 1033 953 953 880 880 811 811 749 749 69 1 691 637 588 588 (50282) 5 5 8 8 8 8 6 Chart by permission of Ned Davis Research: Days 9.5= 8 11000 11C00 10000 10000 9000 9000 8000 8000 7000 7000 6000 6oo0| 5000 5000 4000 4000 3000 3000 Dow-Jones Industrial Average 2000 Daily Price Close 2000 Semi-Log Scale 1000 1000 Pi_#n Nine to One Days Cumulative Equity Line for Longs Only Semi-Log Scale Mnf" Hririe 5 3e 7 Wp itt ami-nic'ritttt  u44 ICig^-n ; nteemF? 777- 'is MnTT 717 Fi7imn'fiS 64 66 67 68 69 70 771 {72 73 74 75 "76"77 78 79 80 81   82 '83]184 85 186  187 '88 "89 90 91 92 " 93 94 95   96 97 98 199 OO M}r Ninety Percent Days, Nine to One Days Total net profit 600.89 Open position value NJA Net Profit Buy&Hold % 53.17 Percent gain/loss 600.89 Annual percent gain/loss 16.21 Annual Net % B&H % -53.16 Initial investment 100 Interest earned Current position Out Date position entered 4/14/00 Buy/Hold profit 1283.15 in test 13532 #of per trade 356.11 BuylHold pct gain/loss 1283.15 Annual BIH pct gain/loss 34.61 Total closed trades 38 Commissions paid profit per trade 15.81 Avg Win/Avg Loss ratio 4.77 Total long trades 38 Total short trades Long Win Trade % 57.89 Winning long trades 22 Winning short trades Short Win Trade % #DIV/O!

Nofri's system, named for its developer Eugene Nofri, waits for a well-defined trading range to develop, then it fades the close after two consecutive directional days. This position is closed one later; on the third day's close. That is, after two up days in a rOw, we sell short on the close, and we cover our short on the next day'$ close. Also, after two down days in a rOW, we on the close, and we close out our position by selling on the next day' s close. Many refinements and filters on top of this basic system are possible. example, to produce fewer trades, defer action until the third consecutive directional and close out the position on the fourth day'$ close of trading: The optimal size of the time filter can be determined by back testing: In addition, could use chart levels or percentage retracements as confirmation to either enter new positions O to exit positions. Number of Advancing Issues The number of advancing issues is the total number of stocks traded that ended the current at a share price higher than the previous day'$ closing price.

Total issues traded on the New York, American, and NASDAQ stock exchanges appear on page C2 of The Wall Street Journal These data are also widely available in many other newspapers, web sites, and subscription electronic data services. Some weekend news sources publish weekly data offering the number of stocks up, down, and unchanged for the week as a whole, usually from the previous Friday'$ close to the latest Friday' s close, except when holidays fall on a Friday, in which case they use Thursday'$ close. Calculations based on this weekly data offer a different result from daily figures. Total issues traded are important when analyzing levels in indicators that are de- rived from the total issues traded: These include advances, declines, new highs, and new lows, all of which are subsets of total issues traded. When total issues traded in- crease substantially, then these dependent variables also increase The chart on page 462 shows the substantial increase in the number of total is- sues traded on the NYSE, a growth of 1080% over 60 years, from a low of 303 on 8/24/40 to high of 3574 on 11/30/99. This growth can distort the meaning of a breadth indicator over time, unless the technical analyst adjusts for the growth by converting his indicator to a percentage of total issues traded long: long: day; 8 V < EMA anti trend ANTI ANTI ANTII Equity (140,806,384) 100000 Cumulative Equity Line for Longs and Shorts, Semi-Log Scale when DECLINES Cross Below 2-DAY EMA Sell when DECLINES Cross Above 2-DAY EMA YtoCC' V(1,514) 3000 2500 2000 NUMBER OF DECLINING ISSUES 1500 1000 hibil 500 10000 5000 Dow-Jones Industrial Average Daily Price Close Semi-Log Scale "1930 1940 i1950 11960 11970 1980 i1990 Buy Number of Declining Issues Crossing Under 2-day EMA Total net profit 140806288 Open position value Net Profit Buy&Hold % 1122877.16 Percent gain/loss 140806288 Annual percent gain/loss 2053964.32 Annual Net % B&H % 1122898.53 Initial investment 100 Interest earned Current position Short Date position entered 9/8/00 BuylHold profit 12538.66 in test 25022 #of days per trade 2.58 Buy/Hold pct gain/loss 12538.66 Annual B/H pct gain/loss 182.9 Total closed trades 9696 Commissions paid Avg profit per trade 14522.

(Here, this ratio has been multiplied by 1000 for scaling: . The daily New York Stock Exchange data used in the calculation is published in many daily newspapers. An odd lot is a order to or sell a number of shares less than a round lot of 100 shares of a stock: The reasoning behind this indicator is that small specula- tors who cannot afford to 100 shares of stock are unsophisticated and unin- formed. Therefore, these little guys are likely to be wrong about the future direction of stock prices. Indeed, the record shows that generally this reasoning is correct: Therefore, it pays to do the opposite of what the Odd Lotter is doing: buy when the Odd Lot Bal- ance Index is relatively high (indicating high odd lot selling), and sell when the Odd Lot Balance Index is relatively low (indicating greater odd lot buying). Indicator Strategy Example for the Daily Odd Lot Balance Index Envelope Based on a 39-year file of the daily Odd Lot Balance Index Envelope and the daily closing price data for the DJIA from January 1962 to January 2001, we found that the following parameters would have outperformed the passive buy-and-hold strategy and would have called the direction right most of the time, on purely mechanical trend-following signal basis with no subjectivity, no sophisticated technical analysis, and no judgement: Enter Long (Buy) at the current daily close of the DJIA when the latest Odd Lot Balance Index is 3.1% above its previous day' $ 2-day EMA of the Odd Lot Balance Index: Close Long (Sell) at the current daily close of the DJIA when the lat- est Odd Lot Balance Index is 3.19 below its previous day'$ 9-day EMA of the Odd Lot Balance Index. Enter Short (Sell Short) never: Starting with $100 and reinvesting profits, total net profits for this Odd Lot Bal- ance Index Envelope contrary strategy would have been $1,789.97, assuming a fully invested strategy, reinvestment of profits, no transactions costs and no taxes. This would have been 31.07 percent greater than buy-and-hold: No short selling would have been profitable, and no short selling was included in the strategy: Short selling would have cut the profit by 13%.

This discouraging result would have been obtained over any time horizon. Contrary Opinion would have been wrong Odd Lot Short Sales are the volume (stated in number of shares; of short sales transactions entered into by small traders who trade in odd lots. (An odd lot is any O- der size smaller than a round lot of 100 shares. _ The Odd Lot Short Sales Ratio is sample of data that precisely quantifies the behavior and sentiment of traders and in- vestors dealing in small quantities of stock: Odd Lot Short Sales Ratios are calculated in a variety of ways. The simplest and best way is to divide odd lot short sales by odd lot total sales, daily data. Alter- nately, some divide odd lot short sales by odd lot total sales plus odd lot total pur- chases The formulas are very similar so the results are very similar: A less profitable variation uses weekly data, dividing odd lot short sales by total short sales. NYSE data is used in the calculations. As the weekly chart shows, on page 478,the ratio of odd lot short sales to total short sales has declined substantially over the 55 years_ Therefore, traditional benchmarks identifying absolute levels have become meaningless The data needs to be normalized and related to an adaptive standard. long: wrong using past Odd Lot Short Ratio 467 Generally; a speculator may short when he anticipates lower ahead. If the short seller is correct and the price falls, he may cover his short position at a profit; by buying the stock back at a price lower than what he sold it for: The differ- ence (the short sale price minus the short cover price) is the profit: If the short seller is wrong and the rises, he limits Or cuts losses by covering his short; by buying back the stock at a that is higher than the he received when he sold it short: The difference is taken as loss. Indicator Strategy Example for the Ratio of Daily Odd Lot Short Sales to Odd Lot Total Sales; and Short; an Inverted Strategy Trading contrary to odd-lot short sellers lost most of our money over the 39 years. Because results are dismal, may reverse the logic by assuming that odd-lot short sellers reflect the opinion of the smart money: Using daily data, we divided odd lot short sales by odd lot total sales. We tiplied that ratio by 1,000,000 for scaling: Based on a 39-year file of these daily Odd Lot Short Sales Ratios and daily closing price data for the DJIA from January 1962 to January 2001, we found that the following long and short parameters would have out- performed the passive buy-and-hold strategy on a purely mechanical trend-following signal   basis   with no subjectivity, no sophisticated technical analysis, and no judgement: Enter Long (Buy) at the current daily close of the DJIA when the latest Ratio of Daily Odd Lot Short Sales to Odd Lot Total Sales is below its previous day'$ value  Close Long (Sell) at the current daily price close of the DJIA when the lat- est Ratio of Daily Odd Lot Short Sales to Odd Lot Total Sales is above its previous day's trailing 18-day EMA of the Ratio of Daily Odd Lot Short Sales t0 Odd Lot Total Sales.

This still would have underperformed and hold, however: Longer-length smoothings beyond 8 weeks would have been unprofitable. As further refinement, based on a 55-year file of weekly ratios of Odd Lot Short Sales to Total Short Sales and weekly closing data for the DJIA from January 1946 to December 2000, we found that the following parameters would have under- performed the passive buy-and-hold strategy but would have called the direction right five times out of eight; for longs only, on a purely mechanical trend-following signal basis with no subjectivity, no sophisticated technical analysis, and no judgement: Enter Long (Buy) at the current weekly price close of the DJIA when the latest Odd Lot Short Ratio is 2.59 above its previous week's 2-week EMA of the Odd Lot Short Ratio. Close (Sell) at the current weekly close of the DJIA when the latest Odd Lot Short Ratio is 2.5% below its previous week's 10-week EMA of the Odd Lot Short Ratio. Enter Short (Sell Short) never: Starting with $100 and reinvesting profits, total net profits for this long-only weekly ratio of Odd Lot Short Sales to Total Short Sales contrary strategy would have been $1,853.61, assuming a fully invested strategy, reinvestment of profits, no trans- actions costs and no taxes. This would have been 64.48 percent less than buy-and- hold. No short selling would have been profitable, and no short selling was included in the strategy: Short selling would have cut the profit by 849, and short selling would have generated slightly more losing trades than profitable trades The only weekly ratio of Odd Lot Short Sales to Total Short Sales would have given itable signals 62.979 of the time. Trading would have been moderately active at one trade every 31.76 calendar Note that this strategy considers end-of-week closing prices only while ignoring everything in between: These results are slightly supportive of traditional expectations, though not to justify the effort: buy buy price Long price long - prof- buy days.

When prices of these three contracts di- verge, Ohama enters a trade designed to take advantage of expected realignment: (See LeBeau, C. & Lucas, D. W. (1992). Technical Traders Guide to Computer Analysis of the Futures Market: Homewood, IL: Business One Irwin.) In trading Intermarket Divergences, the trader initiates a trade when prices of fi- nancial instruments diverge, Or do not move proportionately to a similar extent, or in similar direction. He may buy one and short the other in an attempt to take advan- tage of possible movement before these financial instruments come back into alignment: The risk is that on occasion there is a reason for the divergence and the misalignment persists Or even intensifies There are no guarantees on timely realign- ment. This risk hit, in dramatic Long Term Capital Management,  which quickly lost so many billions of dollars betting on normality that it required a massive government-sponsored financial bailout in 1998. On-Balance Volume See Volume: On-Balance Volume (OBV): ) Open Interest Open interest is the total commitment of or shorts in a futures market. Since the number of contracts held must equal the number of contracts held short, open in- terest is either the number of contracts held or the number of contracts held short: In other words, open interest is the number of contracts held plus the num- ber of contracts held short, divided by two. In the conventional interpretation, when open interest is trending upward or ris- the prevailing price trend is confirmed whatever it is, Up, down or neutral: The prevailing trend is likely to continue. Rising open interest means that new posi- tions are established that reinforce the existing trend. Open interest tends to en- ter an uptrend when the of the underlying futures contract enters a directional trend, as new trend-following positions are attracted by the trend. When open interest reverses trend from up to down, existing positions are liqui- dated or closed out faster than new positions enter the market: The prevailing uptrend or downtrend is unsustainable. Some complicate the analysis further by adding volume as another variable. Volume should be trending in the same direction as open interest in order to confirm the conclusion. price good way; longs long long long ing, price being price price Open Interest 481 The following table expresses the relationships between trends and open interest trends. The simple rule of thumb is that when both price and open interest are trending in the same direction, the future is bullish, so prices should trend higher But when price and open interest are trending in opposite directions, the future is bearish, SO should trend lower: Trend of Trend of Implied Trend Price Open Interest Interpretation Prediction Up Up Long Buying Up Up Neutral Long Buying Short Covering Up Up Down Short Covering Down Down Up Short Selling Down Down Neutral Long Selling Short Selling Down Down Down Long Selling Up Neutral Up Long Buying + Short Shorting Neutral Neutral Neutral Offsetting; Balanced Activity Neutral Neutral Down Long Selling Short Covering Neutral Indicator Strategy Example for Open Interest For stock index futures, open interest follows a clear seasonal pattern four times a year (the third Friday of March, June, September; and December) , rising sharply be- fore expatriation and falling sharply after expiration.

Open Interest; Larry Williams Variation Larry Williams has a different interpretation from the usual one. In his view, open in- terest is primarily an indicator of short selling by big commercials Or the professional smart money players who dominate the futures markets, and who are usually right: Changes of 259 or more in open interest indicate that the big are making big bets, and we should bet with them: When open interest rises, commercials are shorting: This is bearish, particularly in a contango market or a normal market; where the nearby contracts are trading at a discount to the far out dated contracts. Prices are likely to trend down: On the other hand, open interest drops when commercials cover shorts. This is bullish; particularly in a backwardation and inverted market. Backwardation describes an abnormal market; where the nearby contracts are trading at a premium to the far-out dated contracts, expiring further into the future. Prices are likely to trend up. In a strongly bullish price uptrend, if price falls sharply against the main trend while open interest falls sharply, commercials are covering their shorts into the weakness, and that is bullish: In a significant bearish price downtrend, if price rallies sharply against the main trend while open interest rises   sharply, commercials are shorting into the strength, and that is bearish: For further discussion of this analysis by Larry R Williams, see Robbins, Joel (1995). High Performance Futures Trading:  Chicago, IL: Probus   Publishing (pp 227-250). Indicator Strategy Example for Larry Williams' Variation on Open Interest For stock index futures, the simplest form of Larry Williams' interpretation, trading the trend of Open Interest; produced a loss over all time frames.

OP is calculated by: assigning a plus sign to the volume on advancing intraday price waves and minus sign to the volume on declining intraday waves, summing the daily plus and minus volumes while respecting sign, then cumulating the daily sums into a cumulative total: See Technical Analysis of Stocks Commodities; wwwtraders.com, for a series of in- formative articles written on Richard D. Wyckoff's methods. Option Activity by Public Customers: Customer Option Activity Index Option Activity by Public Customers is a measure of public sentiment used as a con- trary opinion indicator: It was developed by Arthur A Merrill, CMT; "Customer Option   Activity;" Technical Analysis of Stocks Commodities; Vol: 8.12, WWW.traders com_ Merrill was inspired by Robert Nurock's measure of options activity by profes- sionals. The necessary weekly data is derived from a weekly report by The Options Clearing Corporation; which includes the total volume of options bought and sold o all exchanges nationwide by customers, market makers, and firms. Merrill selects data for customers only, and he plugs the numbers into Nurock's basic formula, ex- pressing a ratio as follows: call buys + put sells call sells buys call buys + put sells + call sells + put buys This ratio sums the public'$ net bullish activity and divides it by the total public activity. Next; Merrill multiplies the ratio by 100, then he smoothes it with a 339 EMA: As a benchmark, Merrill selects two thirds of a standard deviation from the mean to indicate unusually high and low data points. High index readings reflect lic optimism and are bearish: Low index readings reflect public pessimism and are bullish: In a ten year period from 1980 to 1990, Merrill measured the smoothed Cus- tomer Option Activity Index signals at his 2/3 standard deviation benchmarks for their accuracy in forecasting the direction of the DJIA. The 26-week forecast was cOr- rect 155 times and wrong 99 times, which was statistically highly significant: price put pub- 490 Technical Market Indicators Options An option grants the owner of the option the right (but not the obligation) to buy (call) or sell (put) a specific underlying security at a specific price on or before a specific future date. Options are extremely dynamic and difficult to value. All of their relevant variables are constantly shifting: volatility, interest rates, investor sentiment, and liq- uidity of these variables can fluctuate much more 0 much less than it ever has in the past. Option valuation models are backward looking: precisely quantify past be- havior and project that compiled information forward into the unknown future. That is a very big mistake when the future deviates dramatically from the past: Investors felt a confidence that was not grounded in reality when used a precise mathematical formula for valuing and derivatives developed by No- bel Prize winners Fischer Black and Myron Scholes. Both the Portfolio Insurance meltdown (October 1987) and the failure of Long Term Capital Management (August 1998) taught a costly lesson: precisely calculated derivatives strategies can go mas- sively haywire if variables change dramatically and without warning Even if the val- uation formulas are useful most of the time, only one major deviation of the variables can quickly wipe out slowly accumulated capital. Technical analysis was developed to gauge probable future changes in the criti- cal shifting variables, and any attempt to trade without this tool is akin to flying in a without instruments. reference, here are the basic definitions behind the Greek letters that repre- sent naive forecasts of the future. One should not attempt to employ these concepts without intensive study: Delta is a naive estimate of an option'$ possible price change stated as a percentage of the price change in the underlying security. A delta of 50 gen- means that the might move about half as much as the underly- security; therefore, delta changes with the distance of the market of the underlying security from its contractually fixed strike This change can occur quickly. Delta for calls is stated as positive number; while delta for puts is stated as a negative number: Gamma is a naive estimate of the rate of change in delta for each one-point change in the underlying security. Supposing an option has a delta of 50 and gamma of 10, then the 's expected delta might be 60 if the underly- security goes up one And that's a lot of ifs: Theta is the rate at which an option loses its time premium. Theta can be fast or slow, depending on sentiment and the action of the underlying secu- Time is the enemy of the option buyer: As an option approaches expira- tion, the rate of time premium decay accelerates.

Oscillators Oscillators quantify velocity, and express the speed at which a data series is moving: These versatile indicators are used to express the velocity of price, breadth, volume, sentiment, fundamental indicators, Or any combination of variables. Some of the more oscillators   include Stochastics, Relative Strength Index (RSI), and the ratio of Or difference between two moving averages_ (See Price Oscillators: Moving Average Oscillators: _ are usually constructed from market data covering the past one to four weeks; however; may be adapted to any time frame.

This median marks a neutral point and a dividing line between positive and negative momentum: The number is used as a signal threshold, although crossing the neutral zone will often be somewhat late in the price move_ There may be maximum and minimum limits built into the oscillator formula: Also, there are usually overbought and oversold thresholds, established based on his- torical observation. days` ing, things option thing: long options day: Pay they popular price They they swings point point 492 Technical Market Indicators market can only move in three directions: up, down, Or sideways. It is com- mon knowledge among traders that most markets fluctuate within a trading range most of the time. More time is spent going sideways than trending higher Or lower: In trading ranges, it pays to bet on reversals. In a trading range, price has a tendency to bounce from one extreme to an opposite extreme. The strategy that maximizes its is low; sell high:' So the trader must sell near the high end of the trading range and near the lower end of the trading range. Oscillators are useful tools in identifying overbought and oversold extremes_ Short-term, contratrend trading works fine as as stay within the trad- ing range. If the starts a powerful new trend, without advance notice, very large losses quickly accrue to those betting against the new trend. Weeks or months of small trading profits may be wiped out in New major trends are the most powerful and dynamic when are new. After prolonged trading range, traders are conditioned to think the trends do not last: However; in a dynamic new trend, oscillators quickly hit overbought or oversold, and remain there while prices continue to surge O plummet in the direction of the new trend. When divergences do appear; merely signify a slowing of the initial ex- plosive velocity of a new trend. Oscillator traders continue to fade the trend, and their subsequent forced loss cutting feeds the continuation of the new trend. The oscillator mindset becomes a trap that will cause the trader to miss the bigger picture. Fighting major trend based on some oscillator reading is a debilitating experience that has cost some leveraged traders everything. Oscillator trades contrary to major trend can produce large equity drawdowns. A major trend is perceived only through long-term chart analysis. It is not pOS- sible to see the big picture through the narrow lens of a short-term oscillator: Oscillators can be interpreted in a variety of ways. The following are some of the typical criteria for the interpretation of oscillators: The oscillator andlor its own trailing moving average can be compared to certain high and low critical threshold levels, determined by observation of past oscillator behavior; to judge overbought and oversold levels. For exam- ple, overbought levels for RSI are typically defined as above 70, while oversold levels are typically below 30. This tends to work fine in a market confined to a sideways trading range, but it works very poorly when the market is in a powerful directional trend. The relative levels of the oscillator are compared to the relative levels of the raw price data to determine any positive Or negative divergences between the two. in mind that Divergence Analysis can be subjective and re- experienced judgement to apply correctly. The oscillator is compared to a neutral threshold level, which is often zero or one or depending on how the data is manipulated by the indicator formula: prof- ~buy buy long prices price days: they they Keep good _ quires fifty; Oscillators: Moving Average Oscillators Outside with an Outside Close 493 The oscillator is compared to its own past trend, defined by its own average or trendline: above trend implies improving momentum while be- low trend implies deteriorating momentum. The latest direction of both the oscillator andlor its moving average can be considered: generally implies improving momentum while falling generally implies deteriorating momentum: The recent past trend of the oscillator may also be judged by its recent waves: series of higher highs and higher lows would be bullish, while a series of lower highs and lower lows would be bearish: When one or more to these criteria are present, it can be taken as a partial signal to or sell, subordinate to major trend analysis. When the criteria are mixed, more subtle judgements may be called for Since oscillators may tempt the user to trade against the prevailing trend, can be dangerous in the hands of a novice. Oscilla- tors should be used only with confirmation by long-term trend technical analysis methods. an example of an oscillator adapted to longer-term analysis, see Oscil- lators: Moving Average Oscillators, below: Outside with an Outside Close The outside is characterized by the current day' $ price range entirely enveloping the previous day'$ range in both directions, that is, both a higher high and a lower low. Here, the closing price is also outside the previous day'$ range, beyond the boundary of the previous day'$ range. This pattern implies a volatile struggle where pushes forcefully in one direction then the other; with the direction of the close pointing to the of least resistance, and probable future trend. Therefore, on an outside higher close, or short a lower close. Stops may be placed just be- the range.

Buying at bottoms and selling at tops is always alluring to traders and investors alike. Consequently, many indicators have been devised to signal price extremes. Sto- chastics and RSI are two of the more examples. Overbought means significantly high readings on short-term oscillators, warn- ing of possible vulnerability to downward price correction: Oversold means significantly low readings on short-term oscillators, alerting to the potential for an upward price correction Oscillators are most useful when the market is in a trading range. Also, oscilla- tors are useful for trading minor reactions in harmony with the direction of the major trend. Oscillators are dangerous if used for fading trending markets. This cannot be emphasized enough: It is hazardous to your wealth to take positions opposite to the major trend: A major trend is an overwhelmingly powerful force and must be re- spected. A major trend can overshoot all objectives that may seem reasonable. The ability of a market to register an overbought condition during a major up- trend is not a reason to fade that uptrend. Rather; the high oscillator reading should be taken as a positive sign of the vitality of the bullish trend. Similarly, the ability of a market to register an oversold condition during a ma- jor bearish trend is not a reason to Rather; a low oscillator reading should be taken as a negative indication, a sign of the vitality of the bear: In a sideways or bearish major trend, the declining oscillator and negative divergences on rallies usually indicate impending price weakness In a sideways or bullish major trend, a pattern of oscillator lows and pOs- itive divergences 0n price declines usually indicate impending price strength. Note that overboughtloversold indicators should be employed only in conjunc- tion with major trend analysis as an overriding filter: The direction of the major trend must be our major focus. If we lose this major trend focus, are vulnerable to los - ing major dollars. popular buy: peaks rising we Parabolic Time/Price System 495 Parabolic Time/Price System The Parabolic Time/Price System is a stop-setting entry and exit system de- scribed by J. Welles Wilder; Jr: (Wilder; Jr-, J. W. (1978). New Concepts In Technical Trading Systems. McLeansville, NC: Trend Research). The system is designed to al- some leeway o tolerance for contratrend price fluctuation early in a new trade. As time in the trade goes forward, the Parabolic Time/Price System progressively tightens a protective trailing stop order: To accomplish the system employs a series of progressively shorter; expo- nentially smoothed moving averages that follow the price trend. These averages change each period that price moves to a new extreme in the expected trend direction. The exponential smoothing constants, called Acceleration Factors, rise from an ini- tial minimum of 0.02, and then increase by 0.02 each the trend makes progress in the expected direction, up to maximum Acceleration Factor of 0.20. This adaptive technique adjusts a trailing and Reverse Price SAR) pro- gressively closer to the actual current This SAR gives the new trend the most breathing room when the trend is new: Then as time goes on, the protective stop tight- ens. The Parabolic Time/Price System rides the trend until the SAR is penetrated, then the existing position is closed out, and the opposite position is opened. SAR calculations begin anew on each fresh SAR signal. For example, on the of an initial signal, when a new long position is opened, the SAR is equal to the Extreme Price (EP), which is the lowest recorded during the downward price movement that the Parabolic Time/Price System says has just ended: Thereafter; SAR is adjusted upward by an Acceleration Factor (AF) in the new expected trend direction. For new signals, the initial SAR is equal to the lowest price recorded dur- ing the just closed short position. On the second and thereafter; the SAR is ad- justed upward as follows: S = P + A(H - P) where S = the long-side sell Stop and Reverse Price (SAR) at which we reverse our current long position by selling and selling short: P = the previous period $ SAR: A = an acceleration factor: A begins at .02 for the next period immediately after the initial SAR stop order opens the current long trade. The next and each period thereafter; A is increased .02 for each period that rises to the highest high level (H) since the current long trade was opened. For periods when does not set a new high within the current long trade time duration, is left unchanged from its previous s level: H = the highest high price since the current trade was opened on order: trading low this, day price Stop price. day buy low buy day; long buy period by price price period' long buy stop 496 Technical Market Indicators For new sell and sell short signals, the initial SAR is equal to the highest price recorded during the just closed position. On the second and thereafter; the SAR is adjusted downward as follows: S = P -A(L - P) where S = the short-side Stop and Reverse Price (SAR) at which we reverse our current short position by covering our outstanding short sale and buying a new long position. P = the previous s SAR A = an acceleration factor: A begins at .02 for the next period immediately after the initial SAR sell stop order opens the current short-side trade. The next and each thereafter; A is increased by .02 for each period that falls to the lowest low level (L) since the current short trade was opened. For periods when does not set a new low within the current short trade time duration, A is left unchanged from its previous period < s level: L the lowest low since the current short trade was opened on a sell stop order On both sides of the market; long and short; the SAR must lie at or outside the latest two periods' high to low ranges. The SAR must never be inside the latest two periods' price ranges. If it does fall within the latest two periods' high to low ranges, it must be reset: to the lower of the two most recent lows, for tions; to the higher of the two most recent highs, for short positions The table on the page offers an example of the calculations involved in the Parabolic Time/Price System: Indicator Strategy Example for the Parabolic Time/Price System: Contrary SAR Our failed to uncover any effectiveness whatsoever for   the Parabolic Time/Price System as originally described by Wilder: When an indicator loses money consistently, we can reverse the rules, buying when the indicator signals sell, and selling when the indicator signals That worked, but the equity drawdowns were A long-term EMA filter can reduce drawdowns, but it also reduces total The MetaStock Indicator Builder   syntax for our contrary version is: SAR(0.04,0.22).

This kind of Permission Screening can filter out many trades against the trend and thus reduce trading frequency: (See: Kase, C. (1996). Trading with the Odds: Using the Power of Probability to Profit in the Futures Market. Irwin Professional Publishing: Adapted with permission:) Pivot Point A Pivot Point is an extreme high or low that marks a turning for a trend: To qualify as Pivot Point; a turning must be obvious and stand out on the chart. Another definition of a Pivot Point is tomorrow projected high and low. There are five steps to arrive at these forward projections: 1. Calculate today' $ average (A); which is the sum today's high plus to- day's low plus today's close, then divide that sum by three. This is expressed in familiar symbols as, A = (H + L+C) /3. 2 The next period'$ projected high is two times that average minus tO- day's low; or 2A La 3. The next S projected low is two times today'$ average minus t0- day' s high, or 2A H. 4 The next period'$ extreme projected high is today'$ average plus to- day'$ price range, or A + ( H-L) 5. The next period'$ extreme projected is today's average price minus tO- day' $ range, or A = (H = L ). (See LeBeau, C,, & Lucas, D. W (1992). Technical Traders Guide to Computer Analysis of the Futures Market: Homewood, IL: Business One Irwin.) Pivot Point Reverse Trading System The Pivot Point Reverse Trading System is a simple way to identify a change in mi- nor trend direction. A top pivot is defined as a high that is higher than both the previous period'$ high and the next period $ high. A bottom pivot point is character- ized by a low that is lower than both the previous period s low and the next period' s S For larger - price point point price price period' price price low price point Pivot Point Reverse Trading System 511 low. Either one of these pivot points signals a reversal in minor trend direction. Fur- thermore, we found that requiring confirmation of trend change by the closing improves the system. Indicator Strategy Example for the Pivot Point Reverse Trading System The Pivot Point Reverse Trading System can be an effective indicator on both the and short sides, and particularly on the side. Based on the daily DJIA for 101 years from January 1900 through December 2000, we found that the following parameters would have produced a significantly positive result on a purely mechani- cal trend-following signal basis with no subjectivity, no sophisticated technical analy- sis, and no judgement: Enter Long (Buy) at the current daily close of the DJIA when there appears a bottom pivot with a closing price reversal confirmation; that is, a low yesterday that is lower than the previous day's low, a low to- that is higher than yesterday's low, and a close today that is higher than yesterday's close. Close (Sell) at the current daily close of the DJIA when there appears a top pivot point with a closing reversal confirmation; that is, high yesterday that is higher than the previous day's high; a high today that is lower than yesterday's high, and close today that is lower than yesterday' s close. Enter Short (Sell Short) at the current daily close of the DJIA when there appears a top pivot with a closing reversal confirmation; that is, high yesterday that is higher than the previous day's high, a high that is lower than yesterday's high, and a close that is lower than yesterday'$ close. Close Short (Cover) at the current daily close of the DJIA when there appears a bottom pivot with a closing reversal confirma- tion; that is, a low yesterday that is lower than the previous day's low, a low today that is higher than yesterday' s low, and close that is higher than yesterday'$ close.

Only substantial changes in prices are recorded on the chart: This allows the main trend to emerge as the dominant feature on the chart. Like most charts, price movement is measured the vertical y-axis on the graph. Unlike most charts, however; time does not determine progress along the izontal x-axis. In fact; time plays no role whatsoever in the construction O develop- ment of the chart. Point and Figure Charts differ from most charts in that completely disregard time. In time series charts, such as the bar charts and Candlestick charts, the passage of time moves the postings to the chart from left to right: In contrast, Point and Figure Charts move to a new column to the right not by the passage of time but only   when changes  direction by some predefined box size times reversal amount. If does not change direction by that predefined box size times reversal amount; then the chart is posted in the same column whenever it moves by the prede- fined box size in the same direction as the already established current column. When the does not move by either the box size or the reversal amount; then no new en- try to the chart is posted. Thus, for a stock confined to a very small range, there may be no new posting to the Point and Figure Chart for several weeks Or even months_ price price along hor- price they popular price price price price days; Point and Figure Charts (P&F Charts) 515 In the traditional one-point reversal Point and Figure Chart, when price changes direction by a full point and actually trades at that the next, non-fractional, round- number point; at any time during the trading session, then a figure (which is the nu- meral that represents the latest price) is entered at that new price in the next column to the right: Each price tick counts  So, a volatile stock that fluctuates several full points in both directions in a single might be posted in several columns for that day: Point and Figure purists insist that this is the oly correct way to Point and Figure Charts. This method obviously requires tick data and more time and attention to detail than most individual traders and investors are capable of giving to chart cre- ation. Consequently, the one-point reversal method is used mainly by full-time pro- fessional analysts and traders. (See Wheelan, A (1954). Study Helps in Point and Figure Technique.

Box sizes and reversal amounts may be any size, depending 0 the price and volatility of the instrument: Practical experience reveals the most useful sizes To keep the chart work simple and consistent, many traders use the one-point reversal Point and Figure Chart for all stocks. Here, both the box size and reversal size are one-point, using round numbers only and ignoring fractions For example, for a stock that rises from 45 to 50,a current price reversal to a tick at 49 would be posted in a new column to the right: Then, the next round number determines if the new column is to be an advancing column or a declining column. If the next round number is 50, then the new column is an advancing column. But if the next round number price is 48,then the new column is a declining column. For low-priced stocks under 20, Wheelan recommended a half-point box size. For high-priced stocks over 80, he suggested a three-point box size. UST Securities has developed an interesting semi-log scale to automatically adapt to changing levels in the price of the stock: UST; Art Merrill, and Ned Davis Research have experi- mented with percentage scaling: Ned Davis Research finds a four percent box size with an eight percent reversal amount to be useful in filtering the long-term trend of the DJIA: day post price price price price price price 516 Technical Market Indicators Several less demanding, short-cut variations of Point and Figure Charting have evolved over the years.

Cohen's method uses a three-box reversal amount all stocks and in- dexes Chartcraft allows the box size to vary depending on the price level of the stock, as follows: for stocks priced at 5 and under; use a quarter-point box size; for stocks priced above 5 and under 21, use half-point box size; for stocks priced at 21 to 100, use a full-point box size; and for stocks priced above 100, use a two-point box size. MetaStock@ software can construct Chartcraft's Three-Point Reversal Chart; but the user must specify the settings When stock is in an uptrend, MetaStock@ an X" when price rises by the specified box size (commonly, one point). When the trend reverses, as determined by the declining by a pre-specified re - versal amount (commonly, three boxes), then and only then does the software post an "0" in a new column, one column to the right: In a continuing downward column of Os, as as prices continue to decline without moving up by the reversal amount, Os are posted in the same column, each subsequent 0 lower than the previous 0. Only when prices advance by the reversal amount is an X posted in a new column to the right When prices rise or fall by an amount that is less than the box size, no Xs Or Os are posted to the chart. Each column may contain either Xs or Os__but never both: Each column must contain at least the reversal amount of boxes. MetaStock soft- ware first checks if prices have moved in the current direction (that is, a higher high in a column of Xs, Or a lower low in a column of Os) before it checks for a reversal in the opposite direction. The  software thus posts continuation of the prevailing trend before reversal of the trend. Both P&F Charts shown here were produced by MetaStock@ software_ The user specify a box size and reversal amount of any magnitude. For any box size and reversal amount to change columns (either from a rising column of Xs to declining column of Os, or from declining column of Os to a column of must reverse by the reversal amount multiplied by the box size. For example, as the chart of the DJIA illustrates, if the box size is set to 100 and the reversal amount is set t0 3 boxes, then must reverse direction 300 points (3 times 100) to change columns. When the current column is composed of rising Xs, the price must fall 300 points to change to a new column of falling Os. Conversely, when the current column is composed of declining Os, the must rise 300 points to change to a new column of advancing Xs Thus, the changing of columns only signifies some specified minimal change in the short-term trend of prices. the box size and reversal amount increase, we filter out more and more fluctuations on the chart, leaving only the largest price movements as the box size and reversal amount become very large. for price posts price price long may rising Xs), prices points prices price As price 1 8 56 55] 52 58 Descending Triangle Sell signal at/4g Sgrgmetrical 1 Triangle Broken at a Price of 46, Followed by a Sharp Decline I AT&T (T) Point and Figure Chart 3 point beveriaa amount 1 using intraday high and low J 9 "187 189 /90 J 91 94 I95 S.O /97 10" I98 M JASN 99 21 FFl 124 A'15 b23 M 813 'JJACIs k IN D" D0}1o F M h5 - Iliz24 M16 U,09 "J j0" I0l1 518 Technical Market Indicators It is the trend and patterns on the chart that have meaning: Trendlines, previous tops  and bottoms, Head-and-Shoulders,  Double and  Triple   Tops   and Bottoms_ Saucers, Triangles and many of the other useful chart patterns can be applied to P&F Charts. By filtering out some of the smaller price fluctuations on the Point and Figure Chart, the and more significant trends and patterns may become more recognizable. Recall the Dow Theory, where a chart pattern of higher highs is a sign of a bull market, while lower lows is a sign of a bear market: Similarly, with the Chartcraft method, a mechanical signal is recognized when column of X's rises above a previous column of X's. That is, of course, higher highs. Conversely, mechanical sell signal is recognized when a column of 0's falls below a previous column of 0's, clearly pinpointing lower lows. The 100 X 3 P&F Chart of the DJIA reveals some of the weaknesses and strengths of the Point and Figure Chart: Because the chart is determined solely by the fluctuations, movements disappear when price is For example, the greatest bear market of all time, which saw the DJIA fall 89% from 1929 to 1932, totally dis- appeared from the 100 X 3 P&F Chart. This is because (using round number boxes) fell from 300 to 100, only -200 points, o 100 points less than the 300 points required to register a reversal to a new down column of Os. Also, it may seem odd that all the price action from 1900 through 1997 takes up only as much horizontal space as year 2000 alone. But other features really stand out on the Point and Figure Chart  The third fan line (trendline) up from an all-time low of 100 was broken in September 1999 at 10800, and then became resistance by the time the all-time high was hit at 11700 in March 2000. Also, it is clear that old resistance at 9600 (two tops in January and Feb- ruary 1999) functioned as support in year 2000. A breakdown to 9500 would com- plete a large reversal pattern that could lead to a test of support at 7500. The 1 X 3 P&F Chart of AT&T on page 517 shows the Fan Principle in action: when three trendlines are broken; have three strikes and you are out, the trend is over: This compressed 20-year picture also reveals two Triangle Reversal patterns: a Descending Triangle Reversal from the all time high of 64 to the failed Double Bot- tom at 51 is completely contained within a much larger Symmetrical Triangle Rever- sal. The latter was followed by a clear breakdown at 46, and that was preceded by the break of the third Fan line. The typical short-term bar chart of one year or less will miss this picture.

The indicator was intended to quantify the efficiency of price movement and how trendy or choppy the recent past price action has been. The article contains a highly elevated factor: The basic indicator at its core appears to be a highly complex variation of a price velocity oscillator; where a longer period change in the price close is divided by shorter period average change in A companion article in the magazine offers the following MetaStock Formula Language to express Polarized Fractal Efficiency: Mov(If(C,>,Ref(C,-9) , Sgrt(Power(ROC(C,9,$), 2)+Power(10,2)) / Sum(Sqrt(Power(ROC(C,1,8),2)+1),9), Sqrt(Power(ROC(C,9,8),2)+Power(10,2)) / Sum(Sqrt(Power(ROC(C,1,8),2)+1),9))*100,5,E) where Mov(. 5,E) = the five-period exponential moving average_ Sqrt square root of the expression that follows in parentheses. Power(ROC(C,9,$), 2) = the 10-day change in the closing price squared. Power( 10,2) 10 raised to a power of 2, or ten squared, or 100. ROC(C,9,8) = the rate of change of the close over the past 10 periods expressed in dollars (that is, points, not percentages). Sum 9 the sum over the trailing 9 periods of the expression that follows in parentheses. According to Hans Hannula, PFE readings above zero indicate that the trend has been up. The higher the PFE, the more efficient the upward movement. A straight-line price rise would be 100% efficient: Conversely, PFE readings below zero indicate that the trend has been down; and the lower the PFE the more efficient the downward movement A straight-line drop would be 1009 efficient: Readings near zero indicate congestion, choppy; trend-less, inefficient movement Using the MetaStocka predefined formula, PFE(DATA ARRAY,PERIODS, SMOOTHING PERIODS), and default parameters of CLOSE for the data array; ten for the periods, and five for the smoothing, it appears that the S&P 500 futures CSI Perpetual Contract seldom trend efficiently. Moreover; it would appear that the ranges of the indicator have become more extreme in recent years. So, this indicator might benefit from preprocessed and statistically normalized to compensate for changes in volatility. Moreover; it seems possible that the outputs may be inconsistent with the author's apparent stated intent: Therefore, caution is warranted when view- this indicator: fog price. price price price being - ing Polarized Fractal Efficiency (38.37) 60 50 40 30 20 10 0j 4101 -20j 30 40 Polarized Fractal Efficiency Indicator 50 MetaStock predefined default parameters: ~60l PFE(CLOSE,10,5) -70 PFE(DATA ARRAY,PERIODS,SMOOTHING PERIODS) -80 90 -100 1500 1000 S&P 500 Futures, CSI Perpetual Contract Daily Price Close Semi-Log Scale 500 82 1983 1984 1985 '1986 1987 1988 1989 1990 41991 1992 1993 1994 {1995 '1996 1997 41998 1999 2000 2001 2002 g 522 Technical Market Indicators Positive Volume Index (PVI) The Positive Volume Index (PVI) , created by Paul Dysart; cumulates net price change fractional ratios for periods of increasing volume only. The volume itself is used only as qualifier to determine whether Or not to include the day'$ net price change frac- tional ratio in the cumulative total. Most often; PVI is defined as a cumulative total of daily price change ratios on volume only. Also, PVI can be calculated for any other time interval, such as minutes, hourly; weekly, and monthly Moreover; PVI can be calculated any market index; stock Or commodity, as as there is data for closing and volume. The PVI is calculated in six simple steps: 1. Subtract the previous day'$ volume from today'$ volume, respecting sign: 2. If the 1 subtraction results in a positive number; then the current day'$ volume is greater than the previous day'$ volume That is defined as a posi- tive volume 3. If the Step 1 subtraction results in negative number; then the current day'$ volume is less than the previous day's volume. That is defined as a negative volume 4 If it is a positive volume then calculate the day' $ price change fraction by dividing the current day's price (assigned plus sign) or the current day' $ price loss (assigned a minus sign) by the closing price of the previous Respect the sign. 5. If it is a negative volume day then the current day' $ price change fraction is set to zero. 6. Add the number found in 4 or 5 to a cumulative total. In the MetaStock@ Indicator Builder dialogue, PVI may be written: Cum(If(V>Ref(V-I),ROC(C,1,9),0)) The literal translation is: "Cumulate the following: If the current volume "V" is greater than the previous volume "Ref(V-1)" then   compute the Rate- of-Change "ROC" of the Closing "C' for one expressed as a percentage; otherwise (if the current volume is less than the previous volume), set the day's Rate- of-Change of the Closing computation to zero before cumulating: Norman Fosback (The Institute for Econometric Research; 3471 North Federal Highway, Forth Lauderdale, FL 33306) found that when PVI was above its own trail- 1-year moving average, it effectively indicated bull market for stocks. Our in- dependent testing confirmed Fosback'$ results. We also found that when PVI was below its own trailing 1-year moving aver- age, it to be out of the stock market: A negative PVI trend signaled a huge loss rising days long using price Step day: day: day gain day: Step Step period s price period price ing paid Positive Volume Index (PVI) 523 for the stock market from 1929 to 1932. On the whole, however; selling short on neg- ative PVI trend signals did not pay: Indicator Strategy Example for the Positive Volume Index (PVI) Historical data shows that the Positive Volume Index is a moderately effective indi- cator on the side. Based on the number of shares traded each on the NYSE and the daily for the DJIA for 72 years from 1928 to 2000, we found that the following parameters would have produced a positive result o purely mechanical trend-following signal basis with no subjectivity, no sophisticated technical analysis, and no judgement: Enter Long (Buy) at the current daily close of the DJIA when the current Positive Volume Index is greater than the previous day's 1-year (253-day) EMA of the Positive Volume Index: Close (Sell) at the current daily price close of the DJIA when the current Positive Volume Index is less than the previous day's 1-year (253- day) EMA of the Positive Volume Index. Enter Short (Sell Short) never: Starting with S100 and reinvesting profits, total net profits for this Positive Vol- ume Index strategy would have been S6,591.80, assuming a invested strategy; reinvestment of profits, no transactions costs and no taxes. This would have been 44.08 percent better than buy-and-hold. Only about a third of the 108 signals would have produced winning trades, and the average long trade would have lasted nearly a Short selling, which is not included in this strategy, would have lost money The Equis International MetaStock System Testing rules are written as follows: Enter long: PVIO>Ref(Mov(PVIO,optl,E),-1) Close long: PVIO<Ref(Mov(PVIO),optl,E),-1) OPTI Current value: 253 long day prices price Long fully year g 500000 Positive Volume Index (6,612,101) 500000 Positive Volume Index Positive Volume Index Equity (6,692) 5000 5000 Positive Volume Index Trend-Following Strategy Cumulative Equity Line for Longs Only Semi-Log Scale 10000 10000 5000 5000 Dow-Jones Industrial Average Daily Price Close Semi-Log Scale 1920 1940 {1950 '1960 61970 1980 I1990 Positive Volume Index: versus 1-year EMA Total net profit 6591.8 Open position value NJA Net Profit Buy&Hold 44.08 Percent gain/loss 6591.8 Annual percent gain/loss 91.57 Annual Net % B&H % 44.09 Initial investment 100 Interest earned Current position Out Date position entered 4/27/00 BuylHold profit 4575.25 Days in test 26276 # of per trade 243.30 Buy/Hold pct gain/loss 4575.25 Annual BIH pct gainlloss 63.55 Total closed trades 108 Commissions paid Avg profit per trade 61.04 Win/Avg Loss ratio 8.31 Total long trades 108 Total short trades Long Win Trade % 33.33 Winning long trades 36 Winning short trades Short Win Trade % #DIVIO!

System close drawdown is the largest decline in the cumulative equity line below the initial investment; based on closed-out positions only: System open drawdown (SODD) is the largest decline in the cumulative equity line below the initial investment when a position is open. Max open trade drawdown is the largest decline in the cumulative equity line below the trade 7 entry price the worst single trade. The Profit/Loss Index is a complex calculation that relates the Amount of Winning Trades to the Amount of Losing Trades on a scale of 100 (worst possible performance) to 100 (best possible performance) , with zero representing profits equal to losses. Reward/Risk Index is the Total net profit minus System open drawdown. The resulting difference is then divided by the Total net profit: The Buy/Hold Indexis the Total net profit minus the buy-and-hold strategy's net profit: 3 resulting difference is then divided by the buy-and-hold net profit: In this exercise, initial equity is assumed to be $100_ Both long and short positions are taken unless otherwise noted: Trades are executed at the closing price on the signal date.

Arthur A_ Merrill, CMT; first revealed this phenomenon in the first edition of his book, Merrill, A. (1966). Behavior of Prices on Wall Street: Chappaqua, New York: Analysis Press. In his 1984 revised second edition, Merrill found that the pre-holiday session rose 67.99 of the time on average, based on 89-years of past history. This is 29.4% better than average, as only 52.59 of all trading days were rising The most bullish holiday was Labor followed by Independence Memorial Christmas, New Year's, Good Friday, and Thanksgiving: The only exception to the bullish holiday rule was Presidents which was actually down slightly more often than up. Only 48.9% of the President's rose, and that is 6.9% worse than the 89-year average of all trading days of 52.5%.

Preelection years were best, up 74% of the time. Election years were up 699 of the time, while midterm election were up 609 of the time. In con- trast; postelection were down 61% of the time from 1832 to 1981, though this bearish tendency has totally reversed since 1985. Of the total net stock price since 1832, 74% were recorded in the final two (preelection year and election year) of Presidential Administrations This compares to only 26% of the total net mar- ket recorded in the first two (postelection year and midterm election year) of Presidential Administrations. Every preelection year (15 out of 15 years since 1943 has seen higher stock market: Double-digit have been recorded in 11 of these 15 years. The average annual for a preelection year has been 179 since 1943. In Presidential Elections since the end of World War II, a Republican challenger won the White House from the ruling Democrats three times, and each time the DJIA declined in the postelection year: In contrast; when an incumbent Democratic Presi- dent retained the White House, all three times the DJIA advanced in the post-election year: When the Democrats ousted Republicans, the market advanced two out of three times in the post-election year: It is commonly assumed that the incumbent President is highly motivated to use his considerable powers to insure his own reelection and to keep his own political party in power: Traditionally, U.S. citizens have been opposed to U.S. involvement in wars, particularly foreign wars. U.S. Presidents closely connected to war have suffered dire consequences_ 1. Zachary Taylor; a career officer elected on the strength of the victories he won in the Mexican War from 13, 1846, to February 2, 1848,served as the 12th U.S. President but held the office for only 16 months, from his in- auguration on March 5, 1849,to his death in office on July 9, 1850. 2_ The South viewed the 1860 election of the I6th U.S. President; Abraham Lincoln, as threat to slavery, and the U.S. Civil War began on April 12, 1861.

Franklin D. Roosevelt; the 32nd U.S. President; died on April 12,1945, just two weeks before Germany surrendered in WWII: 6_ In April, 1961, 3Sth U.S. President John F Kennedy approved an amphibi- ouS landing of more than 1000 Cuban exiles at the of Pigs. Kennedy also sent 16,000 military advisors to Vietnam from 1961 to 1963. JFK was assassinated on November 22, 1963, just 20 days after the assassination of South Vietnam President Diem on November 2, 1963. In addition to death in office, there may be some tendency to vote out of office the party in power when war began Or during war: 1. Woodrow Wilson' s Democrats lost in 1920   following World War (1914-1918). 2 Harry Truman was defeated for reelection in 1952 during the Korean War (1950-1953). 3. Dwight D. Eisenhower greatly increased U.S. military aid, including sup- plies and up to 700 military advisors, to the French in Vietnam to prevent a Communist victory The Republican Party Presidential candidate was de- feated in the 1960 election. 4 The Vietnam War was so divisive that Lyndon Johnson felt compelled not to run for reelection in 1968. By the end of 1968, U.S. troop levels reached 495,000, and American deaths rose to 30,000, with servicemen dying at the rate of more than a thousand month. Johnson'$ Democratic Party Presiden- tial candidate lost the 1968 election. 5. The 1968 election winner; Richard M.

Ike gained credit for the Korean War truce in July, 1953, and he was rewarded with reelection in 1956. But Ike forgot to mention that the first American deaths of the Vietnam War were during his second term, on July 8, 1959, when two U.S. military advisors were killed by Viet Minh guerrillas in South Vietnam. Eisenhower's Republican Party can- didate lost the 1960 election: Since 1840, seven U.S. Presidents elected at 20 year intervals in a year ending in zero have died in office. Only one U.S. President; Zachary Taylor; not elected at 20 year intervals in a year ending in zero died in office, but then he was war Pres - ident. Noted market analyst and astrologer Arch Crawford points out that the seven deaths all coincide with astrological conjunctions of Jupiter and Saturn in an Earth sign-_Taurus, or Capricorn. Every time this conjunction occurred, the U.S. President died in office. Ronald Reagan was elected with Jupiter and Saturn con- junction in an Air sign, not an Earth sign, and he lived, even though he was shot and very seriously wounded by an armed assassin. In 2000,a U.S. President was elected with astrological conjunctions of Jupiter and Saturn in an Earth sign: (See Arch Crawford s monthly market newsletter; Crawford Perspectives, 6890 E.

This Almanac provides annual updates on the Presidential Election Cycle as well as other curious and helpful calendar-based statistics updated each year: Dow Presidential Election Cycle 531 Indicator Strategy Example for the Presidential Election Cycle A strategy of buying stocks about two years before then selling just after the Presi- dential Election was suggested by David MacNeill in an edition of the Stock Traders Almanac, Old Tappan, NJ: Hirsch Organization, WWW stocktradersalmanac com. Historical data shows that this Presidential Election Cycle strategy would have been accurate on the long side over the past 68 The only losing trades would have between the end of 1938 and the end of 1940, a time of unusual volatil- ity due to war news. Based on the year-end closing for the DJIA for 68 years from the end of 1932 to the end of 2000, we found that the following parameters would have produced a positive result on a purely mechanical trend-following signal basis with no subjectivity, no sophisticated technical analysis, and no judgement: Enter Long (Buy) at the year-end close of the DJIA nearly 22 months before the Presidential Election. Close Long (Sell) at the year-end price close of the DJIA nearly two months after the Presidential Election. Enter Short (Sell Short) never: Starting with $100 and reinvesting profits, total net profits for this Presidential Election Cycle strategy would have been S3688.03, assuming a fully invested strat- egy, reinvestment of profits, no transactions costs and no taxes. This would have been 73.63 percent less than buy-and-hold, but the strategy was exposed to market risk only half of the time. No allowance was made for any return on capital when out of the market after a sell signal. Only one of 17 signals would have been a loser; so 94.12% would have been winning trades. Short selling, which was not included in this strategy; would have lost money This is a very simple strategy, and there is prob- ably plenty of room for performance enhancement with the addition of more ticated filter rules.

Kaufman (Kaufman, P (1987). The New Commodity Trading Systems and Methods: New York: John Wiley & Sons Page 213). For example, the number of in the look-back period can be varied by multiplying the long-term historical optimal length by a ratio of long-term historical volatility to recent price volatility. By placing recent volatility in the denominator of the fractional multiplier; as volatility rises, the multiplier declines, thus producing a smaller value for the look-back period, making the decision rule more sensitive, and speeding the response time when the market is volatile and on the move Conversely, as volatility declines, the multiplier rises, thus producing a larger value for the look-back period, making the decision rule less sensitive, and slowing response time when the market is dull and quiet with low volatility. Price Oscillators: Moving Average Oscillators Moving average oscillators are most usefully set up as percentage difference be- tween a shorter and longer moving average. Moving averages are widely used to smooth out raw market data. tame at least some of the erratic short-term fluctu- ation that typically creates confusion: All technical analysis computer software should be able to plot the percentage difference, ratio, Or point difference between any two moving averages. Thoughtful technicians greatly prefer percentage difference Or the ratio representations because these automatically adjust over time to large differences in price levels For example, when the DJIA was at 1000, a 100-point price move was 10%, but when the DJIA was 10,000, a 100-point price swing was oly 1 % . While a point difference would show both movements as being of equal magnitude, a percentage difference (or ratio) more accurately portrays the comparative significance of each movement. For fine tuning a moving average oscillator; there are two parameters to be Op- timized: the time length, n, of a shorter moving average and the time length, p, of a longer one_ When the percentage difference (Or difference) between the two moving averages crosses zero, a trend and thus a trade position change, is sig- naled in the direction of the crossing: When the ratio of two moving averages crosses 1.00 , that is exactly the same as the difference crossing zero.) The number of observations (minutes, weeks, months) that should be in- cluded in a moving average designed to identify a trend depends on the length of the cyclical movements in the underlying raw time series data. Optimal values can deter- mined by simple "brute force" a systematic trial-and-error procedure testing various combinations of lengths. For example, if we allow each length to range from 1 to 100 days price They price point change , days; Price Oscillators: Moving Average Oscillators 539 there would be 10,000 (100 x 100) combinations of two moving averages. That would take time to run 0n some computers, but we do not need to test every possible combination of averages. In actual practice, to make this task more manageable and faster; we would first approach it with broad-scan testing using large increments be- tween tested variables. In our example, if we allow two moving averages to range be- tween 5 to 100 days in increments of 5 cut the number of combinations to 400 (20 x 20), 969 reduction. This task can be completed in minutes. After that broad first pass, we can decrease both the increment and the range, focusing in On the most promising parameters for fine tuning: The popularly followed relationship between the closing and any moving average can also be displayed as an oscillator The calculations are even simpler than a two moving average oscillator; since a moving average with a period length of one is simply the closing itself: For example, the 40-week (200-day) moving average, subtract the 40-week moving average of Friday' s closing from the latest Friday's closing price. Then, divide that difference by the 40-week moving average, and multiply by 100 to convert from decimals to percentages. When the resulting oscillator crosses above zero, the closing price moves above its own 40-week moving average, and that is interpreted as signal. Conversely, when the closing price moves below its own 40-week moving average, the oscillator crosses below zero, and that is taken as signal to close out positions by selling: There are three advantages to viewing moving average crossovers as percentage difference oscillators moving above and below zero: 1. We can often see crossings more clearly: 2_ We can better anticipate crossings 3. We can  subjectively interpret momentum divergences  from an oscillator chart. Such divergences may not be detected on a with moving average chart without the oscillator: Indicator Strategy Example for the Price Oscillator; Percentage Difference of Two Moving Averages Price Oscillator can be interpreted many ways, but the simplest way is pure trend following: Based on a 101-year file of weekly data for the DJIA from 1/2/1900 to 12/29/00, we found that the following parameters would have produced a positive re- sult on a purely mechanical signal basis with no subjectivity, no sophisticated techni- cal analysis, and no judgement: Enter (Buy) when the 1/40 oscillator turns positive; that is, buy at the current weekly close of the DJIA when that closing divided days, days; we price price using popular  prices buy long price Long price price 8 40 35 30 25 20 15 10 15 220 Price Oscillator: -25 Close 40-Week Exponential Moving Average 330 above zero, Sell below zero 35 40 45 1500001 1OOO00 50000 Cumulative Equity Line for Longs Only Semi-Log Scale Dow-Jones Industrial Average Weekly Price Close Semi-Log Scale "1900 '1910' 11920 '1930 '1940 {9s50 11980 11970' 980 89g0 120( Buy Price Oscillator; Close/40-Week Exponential Moving Average Total net profit 97517.16 Open position value Net Profit Buy&Hold 331.86 Percent gain/loss 97517.16 Annual percent gain/loss 965.23 Annual Net % B&H % 331.87 Initial investment 100 Interest earned Current position Long Date position entered 12/29/00 BuylHold profit 22580.61 Days in test 36876 # of per trade 208.34 Buy/Hold pct gain/loss 22580.61 Annual BIH pct gainlloss 223.5 Total closed trades 177 Commissions paid Avg profit per trade 550.94 Win/Avg Loss ratio 7.18 Total long trades 177 Total short trades Long Win Trade % 29.94 Winning long trades 53 Winning short trades Short Win Trade % #DIVIO!

Next, draw parallel straight line through the an intervening low for a lower channel line, support line, and downside tar - get where we look to to cover short, to take profits on the short side. Price often finds resistance and support at these parallel channel lines. In the case of a shortfall of a channel line, the prevailing trend may be losing momentum losing power: In the case of overshoot of a channel line, the trend may be accelerat- or growing more volatile. Channels also can be projected mathematically, without the use of traditional charting methods, through the use of bands around moving averages O regression lines. Such bands are the basic line plus and minus fixed percentages 0r adaptive quantities based on trailing standard deviations O multiples of Average True Range. (See Bollinger Bands and Envelopes. Program Trading Volume Program trading buying and selling volume reflects certain  professional trading strategies, including stock index futures arbitrage against basket of underlying stocks. Basically, when futures become cheap compared to the underlying stocks, futures and simultaneously sell stocks. When futures become expensive compared to the underlying stocks, stocks and simultaneously sell futures. Traders use some- times complex variations of the Black-Scholes Options Pricing Model to determine what is expensive and cheap. Ned Davis Research found that when the ratio of smoothed program trad- volume divided by total program trading volume rises above 104.2, it is bullish for stocks.

Buy Prog Projection Bands 545 Projection Bands Projection Bands were originally introduced by Mel Widner in the July 1995 issue of Technical Analysis of Stocks & Commodities magazine WWW.traders com)_ These bands are conceptually similar to several better-known tools used to help identify trading range boundaries, such Price Channels, Envelopes, and Bollinger Bands: Projection Bands are derived by first linear regression line fitted through the closes over the past n-period look-back window. Then, two lines are drawn parallel to this linear regression one plotted though the lows and another plotted through the highs of the n-period look-back window: The relevant window moves forward every such that the price is always contained within these mini- mum and maximum boundaries. The interpretation is Simple: when is at the upper band, it could be consid- ered to be on resistance and overbought; when is at the lower band, it could be considered to be oversold and on support: Projection Bands are designed to help a trader buy low and sell high: They work best in a sideways, trading range market: During strongly trending markets, however; overboughtloversold indicators can go very wrong, as the trend overwhelms all resis- tance and support and continues in the trend direction much farther than most traders expect: Indicator Strategy Example for Projection Bands Projection Bands require experience and judgement to use as Mel Widner intended. Even naive testing assumptions suggest that Projection Bands may have some objec - tive potential value as a purely mechanical, contra-trend technical indicator: The ma- jority of oversold signals would have been profitable. Moreover; these signals would have been robust, with all lookback period lengths from 1 to 50 profitable and right most of the time, for long trades only Short lengths under Il-days would have been only slightly profitable. As attractive as high percentage of profitable trades may seem, however; it is important to note that this and other contra-trend overboughtloversold strategies failed to provide any protection in the Crash of '87. As the chart shows, there can be sharp equity drawdowns Using Projection Bands for contra-trend oversold and over- bought signals would have been a profitable strategy for long trades only.

It is based on Projection Bands. It gives the location of the current close within the top and bottom bands, stated as percentage of the current high-band minus low-band range. That percentage is smoothed with a 3-day EMA: The Projection Oscillator is conceptually somewhat similar to the better-known Stochastic, and it is interpreted in similar manner The simplest way to use the Projection Oscillator is for overboughtloversold signals: buy when the oscillator falls below 30; sell when the oscillator rises above 70. The general idea is that high levels indicate excessive, unsustainable optimism, price posite period equal day price posite day Top prof- buy days. prices long: 550 Technical Market Indicators while low levels indicate excessive unsustainable pessimism: That works fine in a market confined to a sideways trading range, but it works very poorly when the mar- ket is in a powerful directional trend. Like other oscillators, the Projection Oscillator may be used for Divergence Analysis. Here we consider selling when prices are making higher highs while the OS- cillator fails to surpass its own previous highs. We consider buying when are making lower lows while the oscillator fails to break its own previous lows Keep in mind that Divergence Analysis is subjective and requires experienced good judge- ment to apply correctly. Since it tempt the user to trade against the prevailing trend, it can be dangerous in the hands of a novice.

Although strings of losing signals are common to most indicators, indicators overcome this problem if the trader sticks with the discipline of following every signal. Also, if the underlying assumptions on which proprietary indicator relies should be changed by some powerful external development; the user would not be equipped to notice before substantial losses are incurred. Furthermore, relying on proprietary indicator does not contribute to intellec- tual development, enhanced trading skills or growth of wisdom of its user: For these reasons, most thoughtful technicians avoid all proprietary indicators There are, after all, many interesting and useful concepts to explore that are fully available for thorough analysis. And, no matter if an indicator is accepted Or rejected, thorough study of an indicator'$ construction and past performance can offer bene- ficial insights into the nature of market movements, making the student a better tech- nical analyst: profit buy prices good Public Short Ratio 555 Psychological Line, PI Opinion Oscillator; PI The PI was designed by Japanese technical analysts as a simple way to identify over- bought and oversold extremes in speculative markets. According to Ken Muranaka writing in Futures, June, 2000 , Volume 29, Number 6, page 48-50), PI is simply the number of days over the past 12 trading days that the of a security went up. PI is computed by the following formula: PI = (n / 12 ) 100 where n is the number of that the market price closed higher than the previous over moving window of the past 12 consecutive trading days. (The 12-day look-back could be varied to suit the particular characteristics of the market of interest. PI must always range between zero and one hundred. PI is zero when every day of the past twelve was a declining day: PI is 100 when day of the past twelve was advancing day: When PI is 75 or higher; meaning that advanced nine or more times over the past 12 the market is overbought: When PI is 25 of lower; meaning that advanced only three or fewer times over the past 12 the mar- ket is oversold. PI is generally used in conjunction with other technical tools Although you do not need a computer to compute PI, Ken Muranaka points out that PI is easy to compute with a spreadsheet, using the IF function to assign a value of one when today' $ closing is higher than the close yesterday or zero when to- s close is lower: Public Short Ratio Public short sales are whatever is left of total short sales after deducting member short selling: Thus, the Public Short Ratio is computed by subtracting total member short sales from total short sales, then dividing that difference by total short sales. According to Contrary Opinion thinking; the public is not the smart money when it comes to stock trading, or anything else for that matter: So, when relatively unseasoned amateur traders are shorting, want to be buying: When are not shorting, we should be. In other words, when the Public Short Ratio is high, the amateur traders are shorting heavily relative to the savvy members, and that has been considered bullish indicator for the future trend of stock prices Similarly, a low Public Short Ratio is bearish. The amateur traders are optimistic relative to the smart-money members. Thus, this indicator is interpreted in a manner similar to an inverted Overbought/Oversold Oscillator: Short Selling is an aggressive trading strategy designed to take advantage of de- clining prices. Speculators may sell short a stock when anticipate a price decline. price days day; period every price days; price days; price day" they we long they 556 Technical Market Indicators If the stock does drop, may realize a profit equal to the difference between their sell-short price and the lower buy-back price. If are wrong and the stock rises, their loss will equal the amount of the stock price appreciation, the difference be- tween their sell-short price and the higher buy-back price. Late each Friday, after the close, the NYSE releases summary statistics on the total volume of short sales, also separating short sales by stock exchange members from nonmembers (the public) Because the absolute levels of short selling have in- creased in all categories with the general expansion in the total volume of trad- activity, the data must be normalized somehow; hence, the various short sales ratios. Indicator Strategy Example for Public Short Ratio Based on 55-year file of Public Short Ratios and weekly closing data for the DJIA from January 1946 to December 2000, we found that the following parameters would have produced a positive result o a purely mechanical overboughtloversold signal   basis with no subjectivity, no sophisticated technical analysis, and no judgement: Enter (Buy) at the current weekly price close of the DJIA when the latest Public Short Ratio is more than 45.79 above its previous week'$ 50-week EMA of the Public Short Ratio. Close Long (Sell) at the current weekly close of the DJIA when the latest Public Short Ratio is more than 45.7% below its previous week's 50-week EMA of the Public Short Ratio. Enter Short (Sell Short) at the current weekly close of the DJIA when the latest Public Short Ratio is more than 45.79 below its previous week' s 50-week EMA of the Public Short Ratio. Close Short (Cover) at the current weekly close of the DJIA when the latest Public Short Ratio is more than 45.79 above its previous week'$ 50-week EMA of the Public Short Ratio. Starting with S100 and reinvesting profits, total net profits for this Public Short Ratio Envelope strategy would have been $11,646.27, assuming a fully invested strat- egy, reinvestment of profits, no transactions costs and no taxes. This would have been 123.20 percent greater than buy-and-hold. Short selling would have been moderately profitable and was included in the strategy The Long-and-Short Public Short Ratio as an indicator would have given profitable signals 77.789 of the time.

Traditionally, the public (amateur traders) is assumed to be wrong, while the specialists (professional traders) are assumed to be right about the future direction of stock prices. Therefore, high Public/Specialist Short Ratios are bullish while low Ra- tios are bearish: Short Selling is an aggressive trading strategy designed to take advantage of de- clining prices. Speculators may sell short a stock when anticipate a price decline. If the stock does may realize a profit equal to the difference between their sell-short and the lower buy-back If are wrong and the stock rises, their loss will equal the amount of the stock appreciation, the difference be- tween their sell-short and the higher buy-back Late each Friday, after the close, the NYSE releases summary statistics on the total volume of short sales, also separating short sales by stock exchange members from nonmembers (the public) Because the absolute levels of short selling have in- creased in all categories with the general expansion in the total volume of trad- ing activity, the data must be normalized somehow; hence, the various short sales ratios. Indicator Strategy Example for Public/Specialist Short Ratio Based on a 55-year file of Public/Specialist Short Ratios and weekly closing price data for the DJIA from January 1946 to December 2000, we found that the following parameters would have produced positive result on purely mechanical over- boughtloversold signal basis with no subjectivity, no sophisticated technical analysis, and no judgement: Enter Long (Buy) at the current weekly close of the DJIA when the latest Public/Specialist Short Ratio is more than 59% above its previous week's 4-week EMA of the Public/Specialist Short Ratio. Close Long (Sell) at the current weekly close of the DJIA when the latest Public/Specialist Short Ratio is more than 59% below its previous week's 4-week EMA of the Public/Specialist Short Ratio.

It is a sentiment indicator; interpreted according to the theory of Contrary Opinion: Options speculators are wrong about the direction of stock prices when go tO extremes. When options speculators feel overly pessimistic, bid up put prices exces- sively. This inflates put premiums and causes the Put/Call Premium Ratio rise to a rel- atively high level. Contrarily, this is bullish for the future of stock prices. At the opposite extreme, when options speculators feel overly optimistic, they bid up call prices excessively This inflates call premiums and causes the Put/Call Premium Ratio to fall to a relatively low level. Contrarily, this is bearish for the fu- ture of stock prices. Technical analysts generally look to the levels of the Ratio to find signals. We have found it more useful to study the large changes in the Ratio from one week to the next: We get better signals when we see speculators change their opinions suddenly and dramatically: The data is compiled by the Options Clearing Corporation: Historical data for this indicator is available to institutional investors through UST Securities Corpora- tion, 5 Vaughn Drive, CN5209, Princeton, NJ 08543-5209, phone (609) 734-7788.

By focusing on the difference between the close and the open, Qstick is an attempt to quantify the implications of Japanese Candle- stick Charts: when today's close is greater than today' $ open, it indicates buying pres- sure; but when today'$ close is less than today'$ open, it indicates selling pressure. Like other Oscillators, Qstick may be interpreted in a variety of ways. Qstick was pre- sented by Tushar Chande and Stanley Kroll, The New Technical Trader; John Wiley Sons, New York; 1994,256 pages. As originally presented and as still generally computed, Qstick levels expanded to higher highs and lower lows as stock market levels increased more than ten fold over 18 years from 1982 to 2000. (To normalize the indicator; convert the basic Qstick to a percentage by dividing the close minus open difference by the close.) Trend-Following Indicator Strategy Example for Qstick Qstick may be used for trend following: Qstick values above zero indicate a majority of white candlesticks and a dominance of buying pressure over selling pressure for the time period measured by the moving average. Conversely, Qstick values below zero indicate a majority of black candlesticks and a dominance of selling pressure over buying pressure for the period measured by the moving average. Thus, crossing zero can be used to generate signals. Also, the trend direction for Qstick may be used to generate signals. For exam- ple, rising trend of Qstick may be considered bullish while a falling trend may be considered bearish: Based on a 18-year file of daily data for the entire history of the S&P 500 Com- posite Stock Price Index futures from 4/21/82 to 12/22/00 (CSI Perpetual Contract collected from WWW.csidata.com), found that the following parameters would have produced a positive result o purely mechanical signal basis with no subjec - no sophisticated technical analysis, and no judgement: Enter Long (Buy) at the current daily close of the S&P 500 Com- Stock Price Index futures CSI Perpetual Contract when the 1-day Qstick with no moving average smoothing) is greater than zero and Close Long (Sell) at the current daily close of the S&P 500 Com- Stock Price Index futures CSI Perpetual Contract when the 1-day Qstick (with no moving average smoothing) is less than zero Or Enter Short (Sell Short) never: price we tivity, price posite rising: price posite falling: Qstick 573 Starting with $100 and reinvesting profits, total net profits for this Qstick trend- following strategy would have been $222.76, assuming a fully invested strategy, rein- vestment of profits, no transactions costs and no taxes. This would have been 78.32 percent less than buy-and-hold: No short selling would have been profitable, and no short selling was included in the strategy: This long-only Qstick variation would have given profitable signals 49.199 of the time.

More- over; these buy signals would have been robust; with all period lengths from 1 to 50 profitable and right most of the time, again for trades only: Short lengths of 6-days and less would have been the least profitable. As attractive as a high percentage of profitable trades may seem, however; it is important to note that this and other contra-trend strategies failed to provide any prO- tection in the Crash of 87, the decline of 1998 and other market drops.

These impressive results would not be possible if the market were largely efficient O random Random Walk Index (RWI) The Random Walk Index (RWI) is both a short-term overboughtloversold trend fad- indicator and long-term trend following indicator: RWI was introduced by E. Michael Poulos, "Of Trends And Random Walks' Technical Analysis of Stocks Commodities, V. 9.2 pages 49-52, WWW.traders com. The indicator identifies the max- imum RWI value over the past n-days, separately for lows and highs, and separately for short term and term_ RWI computes the difference between today's low and the high n-days ago, and that difference is divided by the Average True Range for the most recent past n days multiplied by the square root of the number of days, including today. By multiplying the divisor by the square root of the number of the indicator gives progressively less weight to the older data. For example, first compare today's low to yesterday's high, then divide that by the product of the two days' Average True Range multiplied by the square root of 2_ Second, compare today's low to the high two days ago, then divide that by the Aver- age True Range for the past three days' average range multiplied by the square root of 3. Third, compare today's low to the high three days ago, then divide that by the Av- erage True Range for the past four days' average range multiplied by the square root of 4. And so on. This process is carried out to an n-day lookback period. The largest value of RWI for the series of lookback lengths from one through n-periods is recorded: If any of these lookback lengths generate a value of greater than one, then the market is trending (lower in this example). Also, RWI computes the difference between today' $ high and the low n-days ag0, and that difference also is divided by the Average True Range for the most recent past n days multiplied by the square root of the number of days, including today: Any proof Many ing long days; 584 Technical Market Indicators The same process is repeated, subtracting each of the previous n-days- lows from today' s high; then that difference is divided by these past days' Average True Range multiplied by the square root of the number of being measured, including today: Fortunately, all of this calculating is done effortlessly with the preprogrammed indicator on the Metastock software indicator menu_ RWI uses separate indicators for the short-term and the long term. SRWI is a short-term, 2- to 7-day RWI used for short-term overboughtloversold trend fading: SRWI above 1.0 is unsustainable. Peaks in the SRWI of highs coincide with short- term peaks. Peaks in the SRWI of lows coincide with short-term lows_ LRWI is a longer-term, &- to 64-day RWI used for long-term trend following: LRWI of highs greater than 1.0 indicates a longer-term, sustainable uptrend. LRWI of lows greater than 1.0 indicates a longer-term, sustainable downtrend: The author suggests that an effective trading might be built that opens trades after short-term corrections against the direction of the long-term trend: close short and enter when the long-term RWI of the highs is greater than 1.0 and the short-term RWI of lows peaks above 1.0; close and enter short when the long-term RWI of the lows is greater than 1.0 and the short-term RWI of highs peaks above 1.0.

Upshaw; CMT; (465 Hillcrest East; Lake Quivira, KS 66106), devised a simple way to make price range projections for a market only the yearly high and low for the Dow-Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), divide the annual price by the annual price high. Next; multiply that ratio by 100, to convert it to a percentage. Calculate a 20-year simple moving average of that percentage ratio. Compute the standard deviation; that is, the 20 percentage ratios (one for each year) minus their 20- year average, square these differences, divide by the number of observations (in this case 20) , then take the square root: Most of the time, the annual range in any year will be within one standard deviation of the average range of the past 20 The following is the custom formula for Upshaw' $ Home On The Range" Price Projection Method in MetaStock Formula Language: Mov((((L/H)*100)),20,S); Stdev((L/H)*100,20) Where Mov is Average, L is Low for the year; H is High for the year; 20 is the number of years in the moving average, S is the for Simple Moving Aver- age, and Stdev is the Standard Deviation, again over 20 years  This formula returns all the information we need for Upshaw's HOTR. It tells us that over the 20 years from 1980 through 2000, the low of the DJIA as a percentage of the high has averaged 79.6%. The standard deviation over the same period has been 6.2 percentage points. These numbers were fairly stable 42 years, 1958 through 2000. The same formula can be applied to any time period O any financial instrument For example, substitute 99 years for 20 years in the formula, and we find that over 99 years, from 1901 to 2000, the low of the DJIA as a percentage of the high has aver- 76.3%. The standard deviation over the same period has been 10.4 percentage points. The wider range and higher standard deviation reflect the greater volatility the market exhibited in the 1920 s and 1930 s_ These formulas might seem to offer a readily workable rough guideline for prO- jecting a range. Once a year's high or low seems likely to have been established, it becomes a simple statistical exercise to project the opposite extreme of the range just plug the numbers into the formula. We might modify Upshaw'$ formula to look at annual rates-of-change of end closing prices, a popular pastime among forecasters. We would divide the last price of the year by the closing one year earlier: Next; multiply that ratio frac- tion by 100, to convert it to a percentage.

That 16% growth rate was double the average of 8%. In other words, performance was 100% above average. The rolling 10-year standard deviation hovered around 12 percentage points from 1991 to 2000, well below the historical 89-year average of 20 and at the low end of the historical range of 38 to 10 percentage points. In other words, volatility was 40% below average. So, the formula says that over the past century, the DJIA has gone up &% a year on average, with a normal range of 12% to +28%, representing one standard devi- ation of 20 percentage points, based on 100-years of history: This kind of simple observation is commonly mistaken for a forecast that may seem to be statistically reasonable but actually is completely naive. Reality is a great deal more complex than a simple formula. Multiple cycles spanning a variety of time frames are continuously converging and diverging in non-linear combinations, de- feating straight-line projections. Investors would be better served by technical indi- cators that do not even attempt to make forecasts, but rather effectively track trends to give timely signals of trend change that we can act upon to maximize Our profits and minimize our losses_ The Range Indicator (TRI) The Range Indicator (TRI) is designed to take advantage of an expanding normalized price range within an established long-term trend. TRI was introduced by Jack L. Weinberg in the June 1995 issue of Technical Analysis of Stocks & Commodities magazine, V13:6 (wwwtraders.com) TRI is based on a somewhat complex formula, price price prices period period' price. price 99-year price 38% Upshaws Stdev of Price Change, 10-Year Aveage (18.582) 35 35 30 30 25 25 Average = 19% 20 20 15 12% 15 10 10% in 1951-1953 10 16% in 1928 Upshaws Price Change;, 10-Year Average (7.3780) 16% 15 15 10 Average 7% 10 -2% in 1974 7908 5000 5000 Dow-Jones Industrial Average Year-End Closing Price, 1915 t0 1997 Semi-log Scale 1020 OCo 1000 616 in 1974 300 in 1928 60 in 1932 g 4910 11920 i1930 {1940 1950 11960 I1970 11980 1990 592 Technical Market Indicators with iflthen contingencies. Fortunately, the formula is predefined function on the MetaStock( indicator menu. At its core, TRI is nothing more than a volatility mea- sure, specifically; a normalized Average True Range. Used with a trend/momentum indicator; as Weinberg suggests, TRI jumps on accelerating short-term volatil- ity within a larger time-frame trend. TRI is based on the basic observation that a large expansion in the average size of the daily high-low range indicates the end of a trading range and the start of new trend in market: Small daily price ranges often coincide with dull, trend-less, trading-range bound, sideways drift: On the other hand, a significant expansion in the daily ranges often coincides with a new and dynamic direc- tional trend. TRI may be expressed as follows: R the current day'$ True Range divided by the difference of the current closing minus the previous day's closing T = the True Range for the current L = the lowest value of either T or R over the past n H = the highest value of either T or R over the past n C = current closing P = the previous day'$ closing price. n = the number of days in the calculation period. X = the number of days in exponential moving average smoothing: 1. If CzP; then compute TI(C-P). That is, if the current closing price is greater than the previous day'$ closing price, then divide the current day's True Range by the current closing price minus the previous day'$ closing price. 2_ If C<P; then calculate T That is, if the current closing price is less than the previous day'$ closing price, then calculate the current day'$ True Range. 3. If the highest value of either 1 or 2 over the past n days is greater than the lowest value of either 1 or 2 over the past n then subtract the lowest value (L) from the value of either 1 or 2, whichever applies: 4 Divide the difference in 3 by H-L; that is, divide by the difference of H minus L 5_ Multiply the ratio from Step 4 by 100. 6_ Smooth the value from 5 with an x-day exponential moving average_ Weinberg suggested interpreting TRI together with the use of an independent in- dicator of price trend, such as moving average crossover: Signals are taken when TRI crosses above and below certain arbitrarily defined levels. Those levels would depend on the volatility of each particular market analyzed. The problem with that is price price price price price price price. price day: days. days. price. Step Step Step Step days; Step Step Step Step being The Range Indicator (TRI) 593 that the number of combinations of parameters, fitted to each particular market; and allowing n and x to vary, could be staggering, making working with this indicator time consuming and complex. Moreover; we observed that the appropriate levels for TRI might drift over time, such that the user might have to adjust parameters fre- quently. A more adaptive approach might be to apply Moving Averages, Envelopes O Bollinger Bands to TRI to define signal thresholds. We used the simplest form; TRI above and below a trailing exponential moving average of itself, for signal generation in our Indicator Strategy Example, below: In his published example, Weinberg used three to compute the both of Av- erage True Range and the Rate of Change of closing Weinberg used 10 days for an exponential moving average smoothing: Again, Weinberg noted that the actual ap- propriate number of days for basic measuring and smoothing would depend on the volatility of each particular market analyzed. In the predefined MetaStock version of Range Indicator; default values are set to 10 periods for computing the normalized Average True Range and 10 days for ex- ponential moving average smoothing: For the S&P futures, these default values ap- pear to work better than the 3 periods Average True Range and 10-day smoothing used in Weinberg' s example: Indicator Strategy Example for the Range Indicator simplified version of The Range Indicator would have outperformed a simple trend-following indicator while cutting the number of losing trades in half: Based on an 18-year file of daily data for the entire history of the S&P 500 Composite Stock Price Index futures CSI Perpetual Contract, collected from WWwcsidata.com, from 4/21/82 to 12/22/00, we found that the following parameters would have produced a positive result o a purely mechanical signal basis with no subjectivity, no sophisti- cated technical analysis, and no judgement: Enter Long (Buy) at the current daily close of the S&P 500 Com- Stock Price Index futures CSI Perpetual Contract when it closes above its own previous day's 271-day trailing Exponential Moving Aver- age of the closing prices and The Range Indicator (set to the MetaStock default values of 10 periods and 10-day Exponential Smoothing) is above its previous day'$ trailing Exponential Moving Average of the TRI itself, thus indicating an expanding normalized price range.

For example, if the current price is 100 and the price 18-weeks ago was 80, then the 18-week Rate of Change is 100/80 or 1.25. Next, technicians commonly subtract 1.00 and multiply by 100 to change the scaling to percentage points of price change over the time interval selected. (Momentum is sometimes expressed as the current price minus the price n-weeks ago, but that creates problems with comparable scaling over time as levels change. > Commonly, when the percentage Rate of Change is greater than zero, that is taken as signal that velocity exhibits positive trend momentum and that is bull- ish: The at which Rate of Change crosses above zero is taken as a signal. But when Rate of Change crosses below zero, that is a sell signal, and it means trend momentum has turned bearish: buy days. long: long: price price price point buy Rate of Change (ROC) 597 The major problem with Rate of Change is that it jumps around erratically. It is as dependent on the old, obsolete data dropping off the moving n-period calculation window as it is sensitive to fresh data coming in. A large change in the market n-periods ago will cause the ROC to jump wildly even if the current market is un- changed. This is a big mistake. ROC produces more than its fair share of bad signals and is not recommended as technical indicator: There are much better indicators to choose from Indicator Strategy Example for ROC Based on 101-year file of weekly data for the DJIA from January 1900 to Decem- ber 2000 , found that the following parameters would have produced a positive re- sult on purely mechanical trend-following signal basis with no subjectivity, no sophisticated technical analysis, and no judgement: Enter Long (Buy) at the current end-of-week price close of the DJIA when the ROC over the past 18 weeks is greater than zero_ Close Long (Sell) at the current end-of-week price close of the DJIA when the ROC over the past 18 weeks is less than zero. Enter Short (Sell Short) never: Starting with $100 and reinvesting profits, total net profits for this ROC trend- following strategy would have been S91,674.62, assuming a fully invested strategy, reinvestment of profits, no transactions costs and no taxes. This would have been 305.37 percent greater than buy-and-hold. No short selling would have been itable, and no short selling was included in the strategy: Long-only ROC as an indi- cator would have given profitable buy signals 43.069 of the time.

The traditional ratio method precisely quantifies the strength of each investment instrument or index compared to another instrument or index. Relative strength analysis is not limited to stock prices but also is applied to the prices of commodities, currencies, and anything that trades. Naturally, relative strength is productively applied to industry groups and broader sectors. See Sector Rotation: The screening method compares and ranks each instrument or index to a much larger universe of all relevant instruments and indexes The relative strength screen- ing method is particularly flexible, since anything that trades can be compared to any_ thing else that trades or to everything else that trades. Published research studies conducted over many decades of actual historical stock data show that a stock that is behaving well relative to the larger market probably will continue to outperform. Conversely, a stock that is behaving poorly rel- ative to the market likely will continue to underperform: The Traditional Ratio Method for Analysis of Relative Strength As a common example of the ratio method, we simply divide a particular stock '$ price by a market index, mostly typically, the S&P 500 Composite Stock Price Index. Alternately, we may divide the stock'$ price by any index of significance to that stock; such as related industry O sector index. The resulting ratio is plotted like a priceltime line chart; but with relative strength on the vertical y-axis and time on the horizontal x-axis The resulting relative strength ratio line can be analyzed using all the lished technical methods, including trendlines, moving averages, patterns, momentum oscillators, divergences, and so on. A relative strength trend simply tells us that the stock is outperforming the market: Note that a stock could actually go down in while at the same time its relative strength ratio is So long as the general market index (the ratio's denominator) goes down proportionately more than the stock' s (the ratio s numerator). This would imply that the stock has a better de- mand/supply balance than the general market: On the bearish side, a falling relative strength trend says that the that the stock has a worse demand/supply balance than the general market Technical analysts compare the pure trend and momentum of a stock t0 its own relative strength line's trend and momentum; looking for either an "all-clear" confirmation of trend continuation or 'warning" divergence of possible trend price price typical estab- rising price rising; price price Relative Strength (Ratio Analysis) 601 CHARTS 84 _ JUNE 1998 DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE IOOOQ Monthly Avg Scmi Salomon Smith Barney Iob 1,80 1.60 1.4 1.20 L0 0.8 0.6D 0.4 Relative Ratio of Capital Goods/S&P Consumer Goods U.Z0 29  31   33   35 37   3941  43 51   53 SS  57   59  61   63 65]67 69 71 7}  75 7779 & & &587 [ 89[ 91   93]9597]99[ 01 Chart by permission of Salomon Smith Barney: Leg 602 Technical Market Indicators change ahead. When both the pure price trend and the relative strength ratio line are both and making new highs, indications are all-clear; Or in gear; for bullish trend continuation. But when price is making a new high and the relative strength ra- tio line fails to make a new high; that clearly says that investors prefer other stocks over that stock, and that can be an early warning of possible price trouble ahead. Ag- gressive traders will start to liquidate the stock at this first sign of trouble, while pa- tient long-term holders may wait for the trend to turn down as well, thus, confirming the deteriorating relative strength ratio line. Conversely, in bearish mar- kets, when the relative strength ratio line turns upward, that is an early indication of possible better trend ahead, but the odds of correct are better when the trend also confirms by turning upward. There is a solid rational behind this analysis In the later stages of a bear market; for example, strong-hands" investors begin to accumulate the stocks have the most confidence in, placing large bids that support the prices, so that the prices of the best; most desirable stocks stabilize before most other stocks. Thus, the best stocks begin to outperform a falling general market, causing their relative strength ratio lines to rise. Conversely, well into a bull market; smart-money" investors anticipating fu- ture conditions will begin to offer out quantities of the stocks they lack confi- dence putting lids on those stocks' price appreciation even as the general market is still rising: This supply causes the relative strength ratio lines of such stocks to turn down_ Alan R Shaw, CMT; observes that relative strength often runs in secular trends that can persist for many Stocks and industry groups in strong technical relative strength uptrends are likely to continue to outperform the market until both and relative strength lose momentum and change direction on a major-trend ba- sis That kind of trend change generally takes months to develop. Conversely, stocks and groups in major negative relative strength trends can underperform the broad market for many Shaw divides the prices of stocks and industry group indexes by the S&P 500 Index, he analyzes these ratios in conjunction with the raw data, and he constantly watches for tandem confirmation (suggesting the continuation of an existing trend) or divergence (suggesting a significant trend change). One of Shaw's favorite relative strength charts appears on page 601. The upper half of the page shows a 72-year monthly price line chart of the DJIA from 1926 to 1998. The lower half of the page shows, from 1930 to 1998,a 68-year monthly tradi- tional relative strength ratio line of the price of the S&P Capital Goods stock industry groups divided by the S&P Consumer Goods stock industry groups. Despite obvious cyclical noise (that is, the smaller swings lasting a few months), the persistence of long-term, secular relative strength trends is evident: The two longest direc - tional moves lasted 11 and 12 years.

Growth stocks outperformed value stocks for many years until 1974 (not shown). Growth stocks underperformed value stocks for 14 years from 1974 to 1988. Then, growth stocks outperformed value stocks for 12 years from 1988 to 2000. Clearly, major relative strength trends can run in This ratio method of analysis is most useful to professional technical analysts and portfolio managers, and it can be useful to anyone following a moderately sized universe of closely analyzed stocks. The ratio method may be time-consuming and impractical, however; for screening many thousands of stocks and other instruments using consistent and objective criteria. Moreover; the traditional technical methods of chart interpretation may be subject to the analyst's personal experiences, preferences, bias, and judgments. To overcome these deficiencies, technical analysts devised the computerized screening method for analyzing relative strength. The Screening Method for Analysis of Relative Strength analysts prefer the screening method over the ratio method With the comput- erized screening method'$ predefined criteria programmed into a computer; any fi- nancial instrument can be   quantitatively measured and ranked, quickly and objectively, against many thousands of competing instruments. For example, the en- tire universe of all stocks, all futures, all commodities and all currencies can be effi- ciently ranked form best to worst relative strength performance. The most prominent advocate of the screening method is Charles D. Kirk- patrick, CMT: He is widely recognized for his research on relative strength, which he has studied intensively for several decades, since the late 1960'*$, when he and Robert A Levy, Ph.D,, worked together on variety of experiments in technical forecasting: Kirkpatrick'$ current relative strength model, which he has published continuously since 1982,has outperformed the S&P 500 by more than four to one Kirkpatrick'$ screening method ranks 5,000 stocks each week by their relative strength, from strongest to weakest: Every stock'$ recent performance is compared against the whole universe of stocks, over a constant; pre-defined specific time pe- riod. Kirkpatrick'$ method of measuring relative price performance is to divide the closing price each Thursday by the trailing 26-week moving average of those weekly prices. Then that ratio for each stock is ranked against the comparable calculations for all other stocks, forming a list of stocks ordered by performance from strongest to weakest: The top percentiles of the list represent the top performing stocks, those with the highest relative strength. Conversely, the bottom percentiles of the list represent the worst performing stocks, those with the lowest relative strength. The midpoint of the list shows the median past performance. again long cycles. Many Relative Strength (Ratio Analysis) 605 Kirkpatrick has found through exhaustive back-testing confirmed by real- time experience that the time interval over which relative strength screening is calcu- lated is critical. As he varied the time window; both shorter and longer; statistical significance declined. Particularly, the shortest time periods, less than six weeks, prO- duce consistently negative results, thus confirming the established wisdom of the pi- oneer technicians, such as Charles Dow, who taught that the shorter-term trends are more Focusing on the strongest stocks is the basis of the sometimes wildly popular momentum investing;' that is, buying those stocks with the highest ve - locity without regard to any other considerations. This speculative taken to ex- tremes, leads to Alan Greenspan's "irrational exuberance, or excessive stock valuations. Precisely where the momentum game runs out of steam has proven to be difficult to pinpoint in actual practice. Kirkpatrick acknowledges that stock can be driven to unsustainable extremes. There is always some danger of buying at a or selling at a bottom when following relative strength: Moreover; when the trend re- verses, an extended stock can revert to its mean quickly, taking away months of price progress in a matter of days. Long observation suggests, however; that more often the strongest stocks remain strong to the very end of a bull market; even after the general market already has begun a decline. The strongest stocks often are the last to be hit by selling in the more advanced stages of a general market decline. Kirkpatrick'$ method has been extensively tested and found to be statistically significant in academic literature. See Robert A. Levy, PhD., the Journal of Finance, December 1967 , pages 595-610. More recently, the value of Kirkpatrick's screening method was recognized by Narasimhan Jegadeesh and Sheridan Titman, Returns to Buying Winners and Selling Losers: Implications for Stock Market Efficiency;' Jour- nal of Finance, vol. XLVIII, No. 1, March 1993, pages 65_91.

These RS ranks are expressed on a per- centile scale, with 99 representing the strongest price performers and 1 the worst price velocity For example, a stock with an 80 RS outperformed 80% of all other stocks over the past year and, based on this above-average RS, is a possible can- didate. Stocks dropping below a 70 RS Rating show weakening relative price perfor- mance and might be possible sell candidates. Stocks with high RS Ratings have greater upside potential, while stocks with RS Ratings are more vulnerable to dis- appointments. The average RS Rating in 0'Neil's models of the Greatest Stock Mar- ket Winners was 87 before these stocks made their biggest price advances. 0 'Neil has had best results combining RS with chart interpretation, catching stocks with high RS long noisy: upside price style, price prices top cyclical price Rating buy low 606 Technical Market Indicators just as are beginning to emerge from a base-building pattern: When RS is ex- tremely high and the price is extended relative to its base, it is time to sell. (0' Neil, William J,, How to Make Money in Stocks: a Winning System in Good Times or Bad, McGraw-Hill, New York, 1991, 248 pages _ Published studies suggest that the strong tend to grow stronger and the weak tend to become weaker over long-term time intervals measured in months and years. Independent academic research confirms that momentum strategies are most itable at the medium time horizon; 3 to 12 months, according to Conrad and Kaul, An Anatomy of Trading Strategies" The Review of Financial Studies, volume 11, Fall 1998,pages 489-519. Top-ranked stocks by relative strength rose in at 70% annual rate over the past 15 years, four times faster than the 18% annual rate recorded by Value Line 's top-ranked stocks (by both earnings and momentum), and 4.5 times faster than the 15.6% annual appreciation of the S&P 500 index, according to data provided by Samuel Eisenstadt; Research Chairman of the Value Line Invest- ment Survey, Value Line Selection & Opinion, Value Line Publishing, Inc. 220 East 42nd Street; New York; NY 10017-5891, January 28,2000, pages 5099-5114. The 35- year average performance of Value Line's top Timeliness stocks (highest earnings and price momentum) is more than 20%, compounded annually, 2.4 times faster than the S&P 500 market price appreciation of 8.4%. All data is exclusive of transactions costs, dividends and taxes Past  performance is good indicator of future performance, according to Jonathan Clements, "Hot Stocks Are Sizzling on Momentum The Wall Street Jour- nal, September 7, 1999,page C1. If a stock has dazzling performance one year; there is a chance it will post better-than-average performance the next: "Winners con- tinue to win, but losers really continue to lose;' says Tobias Moskowitz, Professor of Finance at the University of Chicago. The reason may be that investors are slow to re- act to new information, and analysts tend to change their earnings estimates too ually in an attempt to avoid the career risk of going tOo far out on limb, according to John Bogel, president of Bogel Investment Management: Also, with mutual funds, last year'$ top-performing funds often continue to outperform; according to a study by Mark Carhart; co-head of quantitative research for Goldman Sachs Asset Management, published in the March 1997 Journal of Finance. This study was based on stock-fund performance for the 31 years ended December 1993. The top 10% funds in one year did noticeably better than average the next year: But funds in the bottom 10% lagged badly the subsequent year: The top performers earned an average of eight percentage points per year more than the worst performing funds. Moreover; there is a strong tendency for the worst performers to continue trailing, and this bad performance often persisted until the funds were liquidated or merged:  The pOOI per- formers tended to be funds that charge high expenses and trade rapidly Another study by Sheldon Jacobs, editor of No-load Fund Investor newsletter; found that buying the they prof_ price price price price good grad- Jr , Relative Strength (Ratio Analysis) 607 top diversified no-load fund each year returned 22.2% annually over the past 23 years, and that was 489 better than the 15% return of the average U.S. diversified fund. Mark Carhart suggests that persistence of relative performance of funds reflects more the continued momentum in the underlying stocks, rather than any particular ac- tions by fund management Clements concludes that investors need not be afraid to stocks that have performed well, and should not be anxious to stocks that have been crushed. ~Keep momentum on your side, by hanging onto winning investments, while dumping your losers quickly. Academic research suggests that the best performing stocks and funds in any given year often enjoy results in the year that follows. Meanwhile, positions tend to keep on according to Jonathan Clements, ~Rules for When You Shred the Rules" The Wall Street Journal, January 25, 2000, page C1. Clements quotes investment researcher James P 0 Shaughnessy, chairman of 0' Shaughnessy Capital Management in Greenwich, CT; "Let the momentum work for you. If you've got five stocks and two are winning, sell the other three and con- centrate your money on the ones that are winning: And the minute you see a break in the momentum, get out: Clements adds, "This is also the smartest tax strategy By hanging onto your winners, you delay the capital-gains tax bill, while selling generates a loss that can be used to reduce your taxes_ The top investment strategies stocks with the best relative price strength;' 0' Shaughnessy concludes. On a risk adjusted basis, the worst performing strategy is buying the stocks with the worst I-year performance.

Kirkpatrick Finds that Relative Strength Substantially Outperforms the Market Relative price strength works well with real-time, unseen data over the long-term, ac- cording to Charles D. Kirkpatrick II, CMT: (See Kirkpatrick; C. D,, "Stock Selection: Test of Relative Stock Values Reported over 17.5 Years' www.mta.Org, 2001.) In summary, in July 1982, Kirkpatrick established stock selection and deletion criteria and determined the performance measurement method (equally weighting each stock each week) his first study, which he named "List 1 . From July 1982 to December 31, 2000, List 1 had appreciated 5,086.69, versus a 1,087.69 for the S&P 500, and a 221.9% for the Value Line Geometric. During that 17.5 year period, both List 1 and the S&P 500 suffered three down years, compared to seven down years for the Value Line Geometric. List 1 stock selection criteria included three variables: high relative strength, high relative earnings growth, and a strong chart pattern. buy they buy good losing losing; losers buy price for gain gain price 608 Technical Market Indicators In January 1999, Kirkpatrick started List 2, which; as of December 31,2000, had appreciated 137.39, versus a of 7.41% for the S&P 500,and a loss of 9.999 for Value Line Geometric. List 2 had no down years, compared to one down year for the S&P and two down years the Value Line Geometric. The selection criteria for List 2 also included three variables: high relative price strength, high earnings growth, and a low relative price-to-sales ratio (PSR) List 2 also substantially outperformed List 1, which gained 75.199 over the same 2-year period, 1999 and 2000. Kirkpatrick' $ testing did not include dividends and transaction costs. Kirk- patrick published each list each week in Kirkpatrick $ Institutional Market Strategist; Kirkpatrick & Company, Inc , 7669 County Road 502, Bayfield, CO, 81122, e-mail: kirkco @ capecod.net. List 2 was added in 1999 to supplement List 1, which continued on exactly as before. For List 1, the strong chart pattern criterion was designed to function as stop-loss o negative action, but later tests of the simple price pattern alone showed no discernible advantage was gained: So, List 2 was begun using an alternate risk-reduction approach, selecting only those stocks trading at low relative to sales ratios. Compared to List 1, List 2 offered three advantages over the two years of real-time testing: Portfolio volatility declined nearly in half, with a portfolio beta consistently below one for List 2, versus portfolio beta often approaching two for List 1. Turnover declined and average holding period more than doubled, to well over a year for List 2, up from 22 weeks for List 1. The size of the List 2 portfolio was considerably smaller and more manage- able, 5 to 15 stocks for List 2, versus up to 80 stocks for List 1. Relative Price Strength Rank was defined as each stock's price performance measured equally against all other stocks' performance. The ratio of each stock' s current divided by its own trailing 26-week moving average was ranked against the equivalent ratios of all other stocks, with the highest ratios and the high- est percentile ranks representing the highest relative strength. Thus, the 99th per- centile represented the strongest stock and the 0 percentile represented the weakest. The closing price used each week was the Thursday close. A stock was eliminated from both lists when relative price strength declined to or below the 3Oth percentile. Relative Earnings Growth was defined as the 1-year rate of change of a moving four-quarter average. As with relative price strength, the rate of change of earnings for each stock was ranked against the rate of change of earnings for all other stocks. High ranking stocks were chosen for both lists. A stock was eliminated from List 1 when relative earnings growth declined to or below the top 8Oth percentile. A stock was eliminated from List 2 when relative earnings growth declined to or below the SOth percentile. gain for price price price price Relative Strength (Ratio Analysis) 609 For List 1 only, Chart Pattern was defined as advancing if the latest price direc- tional movement was above the two most recent previous high price pivots, and only those advancing stocks were considered for selection: The Chart Pattern was declin- if the latest price directional movement was below the two most recent low price pivots, and those declining stocks were eliminated. For List 2 only, a requirement for addition to the list was a Relative Price/Sales Ratio (PSR) at or below the 3Oth percentile. The lower the PSR the greater the poten- tial for positive surprise. The higher the PSR the higher the risk: 0  Shaughnessy (1998) argues that the PSR is the most reliable method of selecting stocks for term appreciation. (0 ' Shaughnessy, James P, What Works on Wall Street: A Guide to the Best-Performing Investment Strategies of All Time, McGraw-Hill, New York, 1998.) The basic PSR is the current weekly close divided by the last reported four-quarters sales. PSR was not included in List 2 deletion criteria. Each week the entire list of available U.S. stocks (usually around 5,000) was screened by the above criteria: stock not already on the list that met the selection criteria was added t0 the list. For List 1 only, a stock was eliminated when relative price strength declined to or below the 30th percentile, when relative earnings growth declined to or below the top 8Oth percentile, or when the stock price chart pattern broke two previous lower re- versal points. For List 2 only, a stock was eliminated when relative price strength declined to or below the 30th percentile, or when relative earnings growth declined to or below the SOth percentile. (Relative Price/Sales Ratio was not included in deletion criteria.) ing long price Any 610 Technical Market Indicators Relative Strength Index (RSI) The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is one of the most price momentum indi- cators_ RSI is misnamed, since it has nothing to do with the well-established techni- cal analysis concept of Relative Strength, which compares the of one financial instrument Or index with another: RSI was first described by J. Welles Wilder; Jr, in his 1978 book, New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems (Trend Research, PO Box 128, McLeansville, NC 27301). Mathematically, RSI is represented as: RSI 100 (100/1+RS)) where RS is the ratio of the exponentially smoothed moving average of n-period divided by the absolute value (i.e-, ignoring sign) of the exponentially smoothed moving average of n-period losses_ An example calculating RSI follows on pages 616-617. As you can see by the formula, RSI does not relate any security to any other se- Rather; RSI quantifies momentum. It depends solely on the changes in closing prices. Despite its name, it has absolutely nothing in common with the tradi- tional Relative Strength concept; whereby the price of a stock is divided by a broad market index (such as the Standard & Poor's 500 Index) to arrive at a ratio that shows the trend of a stock'$ performance relative to the general market: Instead, Wilder's RSI is actually a front-weighted price velocity ratio for only one item (a stock, a fu- tures contract, Or an index) And, in conformity with the standard interpretation of price velocity indicators generally, Wilder places considerable emphasis on confir- mations and divergences of RSI compared to the underlying price series RSTs method of calculation, using Exponential  Moving Averages, correctly avoids the problem of erratic movement caused solely by dropping off old data, that is, the problem of the "take away" number; a problem that plagues such popular indicators as  short   Simple Moving Averages, Rate of Change, and Stochastics: Exponential smoothing also eliminates the need to work with columns of historical data each Obviously, the smaller n is, the shorter the measured and the more sensitive the indicator; while the larger n is, the longer the period measured and the less sensitive the indicator. Wilder' s suggested length is 14 Other lengths are 20,10, 8, 7, and 5 We found that the shortest one, 5 produced the best result: The indicator can also be applied to any time frame, from minutes to months RSIs method of calculation, using ratios, tames the indicator'$ y-axis range to limits of 0 to 100. Due to its use of ratios, however; RSI seems to be subject to greater volatility and erratic movement than smoothed indicators that are not dependent o ratios_ popular price gains curity: price long day: period n-period days. popular days. days - Relative Strength Index (79.95) 100: 100 95 95 90 RSI = DAYS 90 85 85 80 80 75 75 70 70 65 65 60 60 55 55 | 50 s0| 45 45 40 40 35 35 30 30 25 25] 20 20 15 15 10 10 225 | 225 220 220 215 215 210' 210 205 QQQ 205 200 200 195 195 190 190 185 1857 180 180 175 175 170 50-DAY EMA 170 165 165 160 160 155 155 150 150 145 145 140 200-DAY EMA 140 135 135 130 130 125 125 120 1201 115 1152 110- 110 0 H18 b25 15 29, I1 po 127 1 48_ 24 22 b8 6 H3 October INovember December pooo' February IMarch 2 612 Technical Market Indicators Example of Welles Wilder's RSI over Four Periods Positive Negative Change Change (Close (Previous Multi- Year Price Minus Close plied Divide End on the Previous Minus by Add Positive by Date Close Close) Close) Previous Pp X 3 PC Sum for P PC NC Pp X Product + PC PS 1968 58.90 NYA N/A 1969 51.53 0.00 7.37 1970 50.23 00 1.30 1971 56.43 6.20 0.00 1972 64.48 8.05 0.00 NIA X 3 NIA 7 4 3.56+ 1973 51.82 0.00 12.66 3.56 X 3 10.68 0.00 10.68 2.,67 1974 36,13 0.00 15.69 2.67 X 8.01 + 0.00 8.01 2.00 1975 47.64 11.51 0,00 2.00 X 3 6.00 + 11.51 17.51 4.38 1976 57.88 10.24 0,00 4.38 X 13.14 + 10.24 23.38 5.85 1977 52.50 0.00 5.38 5.85 X 17.55 + 0.00 17.55 1 4 4,39 1978 53.62 1.12 00 4,39 13.17 + 1.12 14.29 3,57 1979 61.95 8.33 00 3,57 10.71 + 8.33 19.04 4,76 1980 77.86 15.91 0.00 4.76 14.28 + 15.91 30.19 7.55 1981 71.11 0.00 6.75 7.55 X 22.65 0.00 22.65 5,66 1982 81,03 9.92 0.00 5.66 X 16.98 9.92 26.90 6.73 1983 95,18 14.15 0.00 6.73 X 20.19 + 14.15 34.34 8.59 1984 96,38 1.20 0.00 8.59 X 25.77 1.20 26,97 6.74 1985 121.58 25,20 0.00 6.74 X 20.22 25.20 45.42 = 11,.36 1986 138.58 17.00 0.00 11.35 X 34.05 17.00 51.05 12.76 Wilder useS a n-period simple moving average for the nth period; In example, he would use a four-period simripie moving average.

Even naive testing assumptions suggest that RSI may have some objective potential value as a purely mechanical, contra-trend technical indicator: The great majority of oversold buy sig- nals would have been profitable.

The resulting difference is then divided by the Total net profit: The Buy/Hold Indexis the Total net profit minus the buy-and-hold strategy's net profit: 2 resulting difference is then divided by the buy-and-hold net profit: In this exercise, initial equity is assumed to be $100_ Both long and short positions are taken unless otherwise noted: Trades are executed at the closing price on the signal date.

Dorsey and first introduced in the June 1993 issue of Technical Analysis of Stocks and Commodities magazine (WWW.traders com). A revision to the indicator was covered in the September 1995 issue. The RVI calculation is similar t0 the RSI See Relative Strength Index) except that the RVI measures the standard deviation of daily price changes rather than ab- solute price changes RSI separates each day' $ closing net changes into positive changes and negative changes, then RSI smoothes and normalizes these changes by ratios that produce a standard scale from zero to 100. The RVI uses the same basic formula but substitutes the 10-day standard deviation of the closing prices for the net changes. RVI was designed to measure the direction of volatility Dorsey reasoned that a trading might be improved if confirming indicator; used as filter; were added to one of the momentum indicators. This filter; the RVI, calculated strength by measuring volatility rather than change, adding the diversification previously lacking in many systems. RVI was designed to be an indicator that could be used to confirm without duplicating signals from trend-momentum indicator (such as RSI, MACD, Stochastics, Rate of Change, Price Oscillators such as a dual moving average crossover system, and so forth) As Dorsey asserts, Because the RVI measures a different set of market dynamics than other indicators, it is often superior as a confirming indicator . The RVI s advantage is as a confirming indicator because it provides a level of diversification missing in the RSI Dorsey tested the profitability of a moving average crossover strategy and found that results could be improved by adding RVI rules for confirmation: Indicator Strategy Example for RVI Our testing confirmed that RVI does indeed filter out many signals, but profitability would not have been significantly better than the passive buy-and-hold strategy: Based on a merged 20-year file of adjusted daily data for the entire histories of the S&P 500 Depositary Receipts since 1993, the S&P futures from 1982 to 1993, and cash S&P 500 Stock Price Index from 1980 to 1982, found that the following parameters would have produced the following result o purely mechanical trend- following signal basis with no subjectivity, no sophisticated technical analysis, and no judgement: oped price using system price price we Relative Volatility Index (RVI) 619 Enter Long (Buy) at the current daily close of the S&P when the 280-period RVI is greater than 50 and the current day'$ price close is greater than yesterday's 140-day EMA of the daily closing prices Close Long (Sell) at the current daily close of the S&P when the 280-period RVI is less than 50 and the current day' $ close is less than yesterday 's 140-day EMA of the daily closing prices Enter Short (Sell Short) at the current daily close of the S&P when the 280-period RVI is less than 50 and the current day'$ close is less than yesterday's 140-day EMA of the daily closing prices Close Short (Cover) at the current daily price close of the S&P when the 280-period RVI is greater than 50 and the current day'$ price close is greater than yesterday's 140-day EMA of the daily closing prices. Starting with $100 and reinvesting profits, total net profits for this RVI trend- following strategy would have been $867.42, assuming a fully invested strategy, rein- vestment of profits, no transactions costs and no taxes This would have been only 1.33 percent better than buy-and-hold.

Gather DJIA price and NYSE volume data for each hour of trading: 2. Calculate the DJIA total net points change each hour; respecting sign, plus or minus. 3. Total the plus changes (from Step 2) for the week: 4. Total the volume for the hours with plus changes for the week: 5. Divide the total weekly plus-point volume (from Step 4) by the total weekly plus changes (from 3). This is rise resistance_ 6. Repeat Steps 3, 4 and 5 substituting minus changes and their associ- ated volume. This is decline resistance. 7. Subtract rise resistance (from Step 5) from decline resistance (from 6) This is net resistance. 8. Smooth that net resistance (from 7) with a 13-week exponential mov- average (EMA) This is the Resistance Index 9. When the Resistance Index is more than 67% of one standard deviation be- low its mean, it is bullish: 10. When the Resistance Index is more than 67% of one standard deviation above its mean, it is bearish: Measuring the 11 years from 1971 to 1982, over a 52-week forward window of time, Merrill found his Resistance Index correctly predicted the market direction 649 of the time. Statistically, this was highly significant: Over 26-weeks, it was right more often than not; but not significantly so_ Over 5-and 1-weeks, it was more of- ten than right; though not significantly: The Rule of Seven The Rule of Seven is a guideline for roughly estimating targets for a significant move. It uses multiple of the distance of the first wave in the move to estimate (usually three) tentative objectives in advance. For an uptrend, the Rule of Seven method first subtracts the highest high of the first wave up from the low that marked the beginning of the uptrend. This difference is expressed in of price, not in percentages. This difference is multiplied by the ratio of the integer 7 divided by the integers 1 to 7. That product is then added to the original low to arrive at an upside objective. For example, the point size of the first up wave is multiplied by 7/3, then that product is added to the low price. When the S&P 500 rose from a low of 102.20 in August 1982 to a high of 337.90 in August 1987, the difference was 235.70 points. That difference multiplied by 7/3 (which is 2.33) is 549.97. Then that product added back to the original low of 102.20 equals 652.17, which is an upside objective. We can easily set up a spread sheet, as shown. The most point point point Step point Step Step ing wrong price price point price price points The Rule of Seven 625 probable upside objectives are 7/4, 7/3,and 7/2 times the price range of the first wave. These proved to be too conservative, in this case_ Similarly, for a downtrend, the price size in points of the first down wave is mul- tiplied by a fraction, and that product is subtracted from the high to arrive at an down- side objective. The most probable downside objectives are 7/5,7/4 and 7/3 times the range of the first wave. For example, the size of the first down wave is multiplied by 7/5,then that product is subtracted from the high When the S&P 500 fell from high of 1553.11 in March 2000 to a low of 1339.40 in April 2000,the difference was 213.71 points. That difference multiplied by 7/5 (which is 1.40) is 299.19. Then that product  subtracted from the original high of 1553.11 equals 1253.92. The S&P 500 fell 1254.07 on December 21, 2000 -almost a direct hit. Af- ter that; the S&P bounced up 10% to 1383.37 by January 31, 2001.

It has taken the S&P 500 Index up 1.59 on average since 1952. This rally was first identified in 1972 by Yale Hirsch, editor of Stock Traders Almanac, The Hirsch Organization, Inc , 184 Central Avenue, Old Tappan, NJ 07675, page 114, WWW stocktradersalmanac.com. The Santa Claus Rally has failed to occur 239 of the time, 11 of the past 48 years. Hirsch says that when that happens, there are lower prices to come in the year ahead, if not an outright bear market As he says, "If Santa Claus Rally should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall: In other words, if there is no year-end rally, then look for selling pressure and lower on the NYSE, which is located at the corner of Broad and Wall Streets in lower Manhattan, New York; New York: Schultz Advances/Total Issues Traded (AIT) Schultz Advances/Total Issues Traded (A/T) is another variation of a market breadth indicator developed by John Schultz. The A/T is calculated by dividing the number of advancing issues by the total number of issues traded. Various moving averages may be used to smooth out erratic daily movements. Weekly data also may be used in a separate calculation. The Schultz A/T is usually calculated based on issues listed on the New York Stock Exchanges, and similar indicators may be calculated other markets, such as the NASDAQ: The Schultz A/T can be expressed by the following basic formula; before applying any moving average for smoothing: S = (A)/(A + D + U ) where S = today's 1-day ratio of advances to total issues traded A = number of advancing issues D = number of declining issues U number of unchanged issues A + D + U = total number of issues traded each The 68-year mean level of the Schultz A/T is 0.394. The chart shows that the levels appear to have narrowed in recent decades compared to the 1930's and 1940's. We multiplied S by 1000 to convert to three significant digits and avoid han- dling fractions.

This indicator was invented by Arthur A Merrill, CMT; who found that it was highly significant and bullish for the future performance of the Dow-Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) over the next 13-, 26-, and 52-weeks when the DJIA's performance during the during the second of trading was substantially stronger than its average performance of all the hours of the day And he found that it was highly significant and bearish when second was weak relative to all hours _ Merrill's Second Hour Index may be calculated and interpreted in eight steps. 1. Each trading day, calculate the DJIA total net points change in the second hour: 2_ Sum these daily points change (Step 1) for each day of the week: 3. Divide that sum (Step 2) by the number of days in the week, thereby averag- the daily second-hour changes for the week as a whole. 4 To arrive at the average performance of all hours during the week, subtract the previous Friday'$ closing from the current Friday' $ closing price, then divide that difference by the number of hours in the week. (Use Thurs- day's close in the case of a holiday. Also, adjust the hours in the week for holidays ) 5. Subtract the daily average performance of all hours the week (Step from the average second hour performance (Step 3). 6. Smooth that difference (Step 5) with a 26-week exponential moving average (EMA). This is the Second Hour Index. 7 . When the Second Hour Index (Step 6) is more than 679 of one standard de- viation above its mean; it is bullish: 8_ When the Second Hour Index is more than 67% of one standard deviation below its mean, it is bearish: Measuring the Il years from 1971 to 1982, over a 52-week forward window of time, Merrill found his Second Hour Index correctly predicted the market direction 80% of the time.

It used to be thought; with some logic, that a rise in secondary offerings ally to a relatively high level was an indication of well-informed insiders making their exits from an overvalued market heading for decline. Conversely, a relatively low level of secondary offerings implied that stocks were considered by insiders to be too cheap to sell and, therefore, stock were heading for major rally As the chart on page 632 shows, this appears to have given timely signals until 1991, when sec- ondary offerings rose to a high level and mostly stayed there as the major stock mar- ket indexes doubled and then doubled One possible problem could be that there are greater number of public corporations than in the past SO, naturally, the number of secondary offerings ought to be higher: Thus, this data may need to be sta- tistically normalized relative to the number of public corporations before it becomes useful (See Insiders' Sell/Buy Ratio:, Sector Rotation Relative Strength is the most important indicator for stock selection and timing: Rel- ative Strength rotates sequentially from one industry sector to the next; depending on each sector' $ sensitivity to underlying fundamental cyclic economic forces and the stage of the economic cycle, according to Sam Stovall ( Top Down Investing with S&P s Sam Stovall" , interviewed by Thom Hartle, Technical Analysis of Stocks Commodities; V14.3, WWW.traders.com)_ Economic expansions last about 51 months on average. The expansion can be divided into thirds of 17 months each, representing early, middle, and late stages of the economic expansion. In the first stage of economic expansion, inflation is low and falling, interest rates are low, and the yield curve is steep (that is, short-term interest rates are well be- low long-term interest rates). Industrial Production has been low and falling but be- gins to turn upward. Transportation industries (Air Freight, Airlines, Railroads, Truckers ` are the first to rebound: Later in this early stage of economic expansion, rel- ative strength shifts to Technology: In the second, middle stage of economic expansion, inflation bottoms out and short-term interest rates begin to rise moderately.

Economic contractions are much shorter; lasting only about 12 months on aver- age. The contraction can be divided into two equal halves of 6 months each, repre- senting early and late stages of the economic contraction In the early stage of economic contraction, inflation rates begin to stabilize, in- terest rates top out, and Industrial Production and Consumer Expectations are falling: Even when the economy is relatively pOOr; people still want to consume Consumer Staples, which are basic necessities, produced by industries as Tobacco, Drugs, Food, Beverages, Broadcasting, Distributors (Food and Health), Personal Care, Restaurants, Retail Stores, Retail Food Chains, Services, and Specialty Printing: So, relative strength shifts to these Consumer Staples, which are relatively insensitive to economic cycles and, therefore, are considered safe. In the late stages of economic contraction, inflation rates and interest rates both are moving lower: Industrial Production and Consumer Expectations have already been declining but eventually begin to slow their rate of descent: As the late stage economic contraction unfolds, relative strength shifts first to the still relatively safe Utilities   (Electric and Natural Gas). Later; as interest rates come down, relative strength rotates to Financials (Banks, Consumer Finance, Insurance, Brokers, Savings and Loan). Finally, relative strength shifts to Consumer Cyclicals as investors begin to anticipate that the worst of the economic contraction may be coming to conclu- sion.

Gould's idea is that the Divi- dend Yield quantifies market sentiment: A relatively high Sentimeter (low Dividend Yields) indicates general optimism toward the stock market and a possible overbought condition. A relatively low Sentimeter (high Dividend Yields) indicates general pessimism toward the stock market and a possible oversold condition. The Sentimeter is calculated by dividing a stock index by the comparable total dividends (paid for all shares in the index) during the preceding 12 months. For example, if the market index is 100 and the dividends per share during the latest 12 months is $4.50, the priceldividend ratio is 22.22 (100 divided by $4.50). The Dividend Yield would be the dividend divided by the price, 4.5%, which is S4.50 divided by 100. The historical average Price/Dividend Ratio is 24.2 times dividends for the DJIA and 25.8 times dividends for the S&P 500 Index. Extremely low readings below 17 and 18 used to be thought to indicate undervaluation and the potential for stock prices to rise. Extremely high readings above 30 were thought to indicate overvalua- tion and the potential for stock prices to decline. It has become clear that these his- torical guidelines are no longer adequate for market timing since extreme readings have been substantially exceeded for years. The Sentimeter worked well as an indi- cator until the years 1991-2000, when the bull market blew out all historical norms by a wide margin: Changing fashions in corporate finance play a role in the recent unreliability of this indicator: Because of the double taxation of dividends, corporate and individual, companies have been retaining a larger share of their earnings to plow back into their business or to make promising external acquisitions to enhance future growth. Divi- dend payout ratios have fallen and seem unlikely to reverse anytime soon. This does not, however; explain recent extraordinarily low dividend yields because earnings yields also are low (and pricelearnings ratios are high). Sharpe Ratio The Sharpe Ratio is a common estimate of the risk of a strategy It is the excess aver- age return divided by the standard deviation of that return. The excess average return is the average return minus the risk-free rate of return on U.S. Treasury bills. There are very serious problems with this ratio making it an inappropriate mea- sure ofrisk. One of the worst problems is that the Sharpe Ratio fails to distinguish be- tween upside and downside volatility That can lead to the ridiculous conclusion that strategy with large upward jumps in returns but with no drawdowns is a riskier strat- egy than one with smaller fluctuations in both directions and the same endpoint: In price price paid big 636 Technical Market Indicators addition, the Sharpe Ratio fails to distinguish between intermittent and consecutive losses_ For a detailed discussion of various performance measures, see Schwager; J.

Short Interest for Individual Stocks, Phil Erlanger's Indicators Short selling is a measure of sentiment; an expression of strong opinion, that is useful for analyzing both individual stocks and the overall general stock market over the intermediate to term,  according to Phillip B. Erlanger; CMT; wwWerlanger2OOO.com). After many of intense study, the world's foremost expert on Short Interest has arrived at the following conclusions: The Short Interest Ratio must be normalized to adjust for short-term volume fluctuations. This ratio is the current short interest divided by the 1-month average daily trading volume. The problem with this ratio is that it could change substantially due to changes in the recent volume of trading activity, even while short interest has remained constant_ That could lead to the wrong conclusion. The solution is the Er- langer Short Interest Ratio, which smoothes the average daily volume over a trailing 12-month period for more steady results. To judge stocks one against another; the Short Interest Ratio must be normalized to adjust for the historical volatility of that ratio for each stock. Erlanger normalizes by quantifying the latest reading of a stock 's short interest ratio position within its his- torical 5-year range_ For example, if the current short interest ratio for a particular stock is 5.00, the 5-year high ratio is 6.00,and the 5-year low ratio is 2.00, then the Erlanger Short Intensity Rank would be (5.00 2.00) / (6.00 2.00) 75%. This normalized rank can then be compared to any other stock's rank: High short interest must not be taken as an automatic signal to trade in the op- direction. Sometimes, the short sellers are right and a weak stock continues to decline in Rather; it is most significant when there is both excessive bearish sentiment and positive relative strength: This is the formula for a short squeeze that can lead to large price appreciation which can continue until the short interest dissipates. database of historical short interest must be split adjusted to prevent dis- tortion. Most databases fail to adjust for stock splits, resulting in a misleading upward bias. Adjusting for average daily volume alone is not sufficient: Split adjust both the short interest and the average daily volume data. For big picture perspective, Erlanger computes simple averages of his ratios and ranks for all individual stocks in an industry group; a group sector and the general market: Price has an easier time rallying following high levels of adjusted and nor- long years posite price. Any Short Interest Ratio 637 malized short selling for an individual stock, an industry group, a group sector and the general market: Short Interest Ratio The Short Interest Ratio is a long-term, Contrary Opinion sentiment indicator: It is calculated by dividing the monthly short interest figure released by the New York Stock Exchange by the average volume of trading per day during that month: When a relatively large amount of short selling activity is evident, traders obvi- ously have speculated that stock are likely to move lower: A relatively high Short Interest Ratio adds to potential buying demand for stocks because bears must eventually cover their shorts (that is, must the stock previously sold short). This buying power is potential fuel for a rally: Relatively low levels of short selling produce low Short Interest Ratio readings. These low levels are not bullish because represent little buying power: The Short Interest Ratio has changed its behavior substantially over the past two decades, with the dynamic growth of new derivative markets for options and futures. These, plus active mergers and acquisitions activity, have produced a proliferation of complex arbitrage strategies. In the early 1980's, less than 25% of the NYSE issues reporting short interest were affected by arbitrage transactions, but that rose to more than 50% later in that decade. We need an adaptive, evolving technical indicator to keep pace with these changing levels of activity: Indicator Strategy Example for the Short Interest Ratio Based on 69-years of monthly data for the Short Interest Ratio and the DJIA from January,1932, through December; 2000, we found that the following parameters would have produced a positive result on purely mechanical trend-following signal basis with no subjectivity, no sophisticated technical analysis, and no judgement: Enter Long (Buy) at the current month-end close of the DJIA when the current Short Interest Ratio is greater than the previous month 's 74- month EMA of the Short Interest Ratio.

The Simple Moving Average (SMA) is probably the simplest; oldest; and most widely used statistical method applied to stock price data. For example, the 200-day simple moving average has been a popular and moderately effective to stock market transaction timing for many decades. To compute it; we simply add together the closing for the past 200 trading then divide that sum by 200. Before computers, technicians took a shortcut, adding up the weekly closing prices over 40 weeks, then dividing by 40. Assuming five trading days in a week, 200 days is 40 weeks (200/5=40). Or; if were extremely computationally adverse, added 10 month-end closing then divided by 10. Assuming twenty trading days in a month, 200 days is 10 months (200/20=10). All three methods produce nearly the same result, result enough to encourage increasing popularity of this major long: long: Ck-n+2 Ck-n+3 guide prices days; they they prices good Simple Moving Average (SMA): Moving Arithmetic Mean 645 Example of Simple Moving Average of Four Periods Four-Period Four-Period Price Moving Simple Moving NYSE Total Average Year End Close (T + 4) 1968 58.90 1969 51.53 1970 50.23 1971 56.43 217.09 54.27 1972 64.48 222.67 55.67 1973 51.82 222.96 55.74 1974 36.13 208.86 52.22 1975 47.64 200.07 50.02 1976 57.88 193.47 48.37 1977 52.50 194.15 48.54 1978 53.62 211.64 52.91 1979 61.95 225.95 56.49 1980 77.86 245.93 61.48 1981 71.11 264.54 66.14 1982 81.03 291.95 72.99 1983 95.18 325.18 81.30 1984 96.38 343.70 85.93 1985 121.58 394.17 98.54 1986 138.58 451.72 112.93 trend following indicator over the decades. Despite its simplicity, the SMA is a use- ful tool for identifying and following trends and smoothing data of all kinds Since only two prices affect the most recent SMA, updating the calculation can be accomplished quickly without a computer: For example, to maintain a 10-month SMA; at each month end, we would subtract the oldest data, now Il months old, from our 10-month moving total. Then, add the latest data to the moving total. Finally, we divide that new moving total by the number of periods averaged, which in this ex- ample of 10 periods simply involves placing the decimal before the last digit of the moving total: Indicator Strategy Example for the Simple Moving Average (SMA) Based on the daily closing for the DJIA from 1900 to 2001, Simple Moving Average Crossover Strategies of all lengths from to 385 would have been profitable and would have beaten the passive buy-and-hold strategy The 1- 4-, and 5-day SMA would have produced maximum net profits in the billions of dollars, price we point prices 1-day days 8 DJIA with SMA Simple Moving Average, long-term,  Equity 500000 126-day Simple Moving Average Crossover Strategy Cumulative Equity Line for Longs and Shorts Semi-Log Scale Dow-Jones Industrial Average Daily Price Close Semi-Log Scale with 126-day Simple Moving Average 1900 lig1o 11gz0 1930 940 I1950 1960 1970 i1980 I1990 '20 126-Day SMA Crossover Strategy Total net profit 426745.59 Open position value 20677.37 Net Profit Buy&Hold 2022.54 Percent gain/loss 426745.59 Annual percent gain/loss 4211.04 Annual Net % B&H % 2022.50 Initial investment 100 Interest earned Current position Short Date position entered 3/9/01 BuylHold profit 20105.4 Days in test 36989 # of per trade 41.75 Buy/Hold pct gain/loss 20105.4 Annual BIH pct gainlloss 198.4 Total closed trades 886 Commissions paid Avg profit per trade 458.32 Win/Avg Loss ratio 5.56 Total long trades 443 Total short trades 443 Long Win Trade % 24.83 Winning long trades 110 Winning short trades 75 Short Win Trade % 16.93 Total winning trades 185 Total losing trades 701 Total Win Trade % 20.88 Amount of winning trades 1273965.75 Amount of losing trades 867897.5 Net Profit Margin % 18.96 Average win 6886.3 Average loss 1238.08 Average P.

For these reasons_ specialists are considered to be the smart money when it comes to trading: If they are not market savvy, they will not be able to remain in the specialist business over the long run: Specialists are mostly right about the future trend of stock prices Therefore, low specialist short selling is bullish, and high specialist shorting is bearish: Thus, this indicator is interpreted in a manner similar to an Overbought/Oversold Oscillator: A short sale is a bet that a stock will fall. A trader will place an order to "Sell Short" a stock he has no existing position in when he feels confident that its price is likely to decline significantly: (The trader's broker seamlessly arranges for the trader to borrow the stock: Some illiquid stocks cannot be borrowed and, therefore, cannot be sold short.) Eventually, the trader must place a buy order to "Cover Short" to close out his short position: at a profit if the stock price declines as anticipated, or at a loss if the stock price rises unexpectedly: Indicator Strategy Example for Specialist Short Ratio Based on a 55-year file of Specialist Short Ratios and weekly closing data for the DJIA from January 1946 to December 2000, we found that the following para- meters would have slightly underperformed the passive buy-and-hold strategy but along how; lag, price price they price 8 Specialist Short Rato Equity (4,930) 5000 Cumulative Equity Line for Longs Only Semi-Log Scale Specialist Short Ratio (4,231) 7500 7000 6500 6000 5500  5600 W 4000 3500 3000 10000= Specialist Short Ratio (Specialist Shorts Total Shorts) 1000 5000 Dow-Jones Industrial Average Weekly Price Close Semi-Log Scale J1g40 h9so 1950 '1970. ho8o 81990 200 k HHA Specialist Short Ratio (Envelope) Total net profit 4829.91 Open position value NJA Net Profit Buy&Hold ~7.43 Percent gain/loss 4829.91 Annual percent gain/loss 87.84 Annual Net % B&H % -7.43 Initial investment 100 Interest earned Current position Out Date position entered 2/14/97 Buy/Hold profit 5217.78 Days in test 20070 # of per trade 2508.75 Buy/Hold pct gain/loss 5217.78 Annual BIH pct gainlloss 94.89 Total closed trades Commissions paid Avg profit per trade 603.74 Win/Avg Loss ratio NJA Total long trades Total short trades Long Win Trade % 100.00 Winning long trades Winning short trades Short Win Trade % #DIVIO!

Gould was educated as an engineer; and he used his knowledge, long experience, and intuition to conceptualize structures of market movements. Gould viewed market movements as the meaningful unfolding of underlying significant forces of accumulation and distribution: Speed Resistance Lines move at a fraction of the pace of the preceding signifi- cant market price move. Rising Speed Resistance Lines move up at rates of speed that are one-third and two-thirds the rate of a previous notable advance from a significant low to a significant high. Falling Speed Resistance Lines move down at rates of speed that are one-third and two-thirds the rate of a previous notable decline from a signif- icant high to a significant lw. There are few turning points year that really stand out on the chart, and these are the significant highs and lows. To compute Rising Speed Resistance Lines, subtract the price at an outstanding low from the at subsequent important rally Divide that difference into thirds. Add one-third and then two-thirds to the original low. On an arithmetically scaled chart; directly below and on the exact date of the outstanding rally peak, mark these two calculated points, at one-third and two-thirds of the total rally advance in price, from low to high. Draw straight lines from the low through these two points. These straight lines are the One-Third and Two-Thirds Speed Resistance Lines The procedure is similar for Speed Resistance Lines, which are drawn down from high through one-third and two-thirds the distance above a subsequent low They - price peak: falling points 654 Technical Market Indicators For downside corrections or reactions against strong bullish trend, should find support at the rising Two-Thirds Speed Resistance Line. If that support fails, however; price may then fall to the One-Third Speed Resistance Line, where it should find support: The chart shows that the Rising One-Third Speed Resistance Line from the 1982 low to the 1987 high provided precise support in the Crash of '87. The related Two-Thirds Speed Resistance Line provided six of guidance reminiscent of a median line on the subsequent trend from 1988 to 1994. In a bear market, oversold rallies and dead cat bounces should find resistance at the falling Two-Thirds Resistance Speed Line. If that resistance fails to stop the recovery, however; may then rise up to the One-Third Speed Resistance Line, where it should find resistance_ Note that MetaStock@ software by Equis International (WwWequis.com) also automatically draws a Three-Thirds Speed Resistance Line from low to high (or from high to low). This is not discussed much but appears to be interesting at times when extended out into the future. The 3/3, Three-Thirds Speed Resistance Line drawn from the 1982 low to the 1983 high was never exceeded but was fairly closely ap- proached at the end of the steep bull market that ended in March 2000. Also, note that the 3/3, Three-Thirds Speed Resistance Line drawn from the December 1994 to the 1996 high seemed to provid structure to the subsequent bullish trend. Springboard Springboard occurs when breaks out above or below resistance or support level but immediately reverses with a forceful move in the opposite direction.

' Stage Statistics 657 Standard Deviation Standard deviation is statistical measurement of data  dispersion, or  scatter; or volatility: It is a quantification of the variability of the distribution of the raw data around a simple moving average. Standard deviation is calculated in six steps: 1. Compute a simple average of the raw data over the relevant time interval se- lected, by summing the observed values and then dividing by the total num- ber of observations_ 2 Compute the differences between each observation (the raw data for each time period) and the average of all observations (from the first step). 3. Compute the squares of these differences. 4 Sum the squares of the differences. 5. Divide this sum of squares by the number of observations to arrive at the variance. 6_ Calculate the square root of this variance to arrive at the standard deviation, quantification of the variability of the distribution of the raw data around the moving average. Standard deviation is symbolized by the Greek letter sigma, €. In many cal applications it is worth knowing whether the data points are clustered tightly around the mean or dispersed widely over a range and by how much: If the standard deviation is small, the individual data points are tightly clustered around the mean. But if the standard deviation is large, the individual data points are widely scattered around the mean. (See Bollinger Bands, for an example of a popular technical indi- cator that uses standard deviation.) Statistics The technical indicators in this book are simple mathematical models. Being simple, are easy to understand, compute, and implement. Simplicity is a very important criterion for selecting an investment method. A mathematical model is simply an idealized representation of reality in the form of a clearly defined formula, or more than one formula combined into syS - tem. Fortunately, though perhaps counter-intuitively, simple models actually work better than complex systems. If we can 't understand it; we won t use it_ Technical analysts have used simple statistics. There is no evidence that ad- vanced, complex statistics work any better than the simplest statistics. In fact, expe- rience strongly suggests that the opposite is true, that simple statistics work better than advanced and complex statistics. practi- they long 658 Technical Market Indicators Technicians use moving averages more than any other statistic. Moving aver- ages are simple and easy-to-understand mathematical measures of the underlying trend. Raw market data can be noisy, and technical analysts recognized decades ago that moving averages can smooth the data enough to reveal the trend. Moving aver- ages of the daily closing reliably follow the price trend. Also, often provide support and resistance. Traditionally, for many decades, technicians have used moving averages cover - ing windows of time of the past 10 months, 10 weeks, and 10 days to identify and fol- low intermediate-_ and short-term trends. To calculate 10-period simple moving average, simply add together the daily closing over the past 10 pe- riods then divide that sum by 10. Curiously, ten months is slightly more than 200 trad- ing which is the most popular moving average of the long-term, major trend. The computer can quickly add together the daily closing prices over the past 200 and divide that sum by 200 to find the 200-day simple moving average. Then, if the current closing price is higher than the moving average, the long-term trend is as- sumed to be upward (bullish) and the financial instrument in question is a candi- date. On the other hand, if the current closing price is than the 200-day moving average, then the main trend is downward (bearish) and the instrument is a sell can- didate. simple moving averages covering all three time frames (10 months, 10 weeks, and 10 days) together offers confirmation and other advantages. (See Multiple Time Frame Analysis: Some technical indicators use the variability of the distribution of the data around the moving average. Sometimes, it may seem significant to know whether the data points are clustered tightly around the mean Or dispersed widely over range. The standard deviation is simply the square root of the mean of the squares of the de- viations. In other words, we calculate the difference f each observed data mi- nus the mean Or average of the recent past data points, square these differences, then we divide these squared numbers by the number of observations under consid- eration (which is symbolized by the letter n). This standard deviation is traditionally designated by forbidding Greek letter; sigma, but it is actually a very simple con- cept If the standard deviation is small, the individual data are tightly clustered around the mean. But if the standard deviation is the individual data points are widely scattered around the mean. The variance is simply the square of the standard deviation. Correlation is a measure of relatedness. When two data series increase Or de- crease proportionately and simultaneously, are correlated positively. A perfect positive correlation results in a coefficient of + 1. At the opposite extreme, if one data series increases in the same proportion that the other decreases; the two are negatively correlated. A perfect negative correlation produces a coefficient of _ 1. A total ab- sence of correlation would be a coefficient of 0. Intermediate values are interpreted they price long-, prices we days; days buy lower Using point we points large, they STIX: The Polymetric Short-term Indicator 659 by degree. A high positive correlation would be 0.75. A high negative correlation would be -0.75_ Alow positive correlation would be 0.25.A low negative correlation would be -0.25. There are also tests of reliability designed to tell uS whether an indicator is valid Or not. Statisticians have devised several tests for the significance O reliability of data. One refer to in this book is the chi-square test: Here, the deviations (observed indicator values minus expected random values) are squared, divided by the expected values, and summed. The value of chi-square is then compared with values in a stan- dard statistical table to determine the significance of the deviations. Back testing an indicator substantial historical data going back many yields a clear simulated record of and sell signals and a Cumulative Equity Curve. This curve can be compared against the record of the passive Buy-and-Hold Strategy: If the curve shows greater with less risk (that is, less negative vari- ability, or fewer large losses), then it is clear that the indicator adds value to the in- vestment decision making process. Usually, this will be obvious by simple visual inspection of the chart of Cumulative Equity versus the unmanaged underlying secu- rity. No number crunching is required. Taking the time to learn to comfortably read charts pays unexpected dividends in able to grasp the meaning of data in more powerful and insightful ways than any abstract statistic possibly could reveal. Experienced technical analysts develop a strong sense of statistical significance by simply inspecting a graph of the actual data. It is an art well worth cultivating: STIX: The Polymetric Short-term Indicator STIX is an exponentially smoothed, breadth-momentum oscillator developed by The Polymetric Report. A 9% (or 21-day) exponential smoothing constant applied to the number of advancing issues divided by the sum of the number of advancing issues plus the number of declining issues. STIX is usually calculated based on issues listed on the New York Stock Exchange, and similar indicators may be calculated for other markets, such as the NASDAQ. STIX may be expressed by the following formula: S = ( ( (A/(A + D) ) 0.09 ) + ( P* 0.91 ) where S = today'$ STIX A number of advancing issues D number of declining issues P = previous day's STIX we using buy years profit being 660 Technical Market Indicators STIX is usually multiplied by 100 to avoid dealing with fractions. STIX oscil- lates around perfectly balanced number of 50, where advances and declines are equal. One may start calculating STIX with an initial value of 50 at any point in time, ideally after a sideways market trend, although STIX will be accurate within a few weeks no matter when it is started. Record ranges for STIX are from 28 to 69, low to high; both set in 1932. Tradi- tionally, high levels above 58 were thought to indicate strong bullish breadth mo- mentum, while low levels below 40 indicated bearish momentum. As the graph shows, however; breadth volatility has diminished in recent years, producing no sig- nals for STIX based on thresholds of 40 and 58. Trends, comparative levels, and divergences in STIX have been interpreted rel- ative to market index in typical oscillator fashion. For example, a positive di- vergence in STIX on a re-test of previous index lows is generally thought to indicate diminishing imbalance of supply over demand, and that may be a bullish leading indicator of the short-term trend. On the other hand, a negative divergence in STIX on a re-test of 'previous price index highs indicates a diminishing imbalance of demand over supply, and that is a bearish leading indicator of the short-term trend. Indicator Strategy Example for STIX Based on a 68-year file of daily data for the number of shares advancing and declin- ing each day on the NYSE and the DJIA since March &, 1932, we found that a simple trend-following rule would have produced a positive result on purely mechanical signal basis with no subjectivity, no sophisticated   technical   analysis, and no judgement: Enter Long (Buy) at the current daily close of the DJIA when STIX crosses above 49. Close Long (Sell) at the current daily close of the DJIA when STIX crosses below 49. Enter Short (Sell Short) at the current daily price close of the DJIA when STIX crosses below 49. Close Short (Cover) at the current daily close of the DJIA when STIX crosses above 49. Starting with $100 and reinvesting profits, total net profits for this STIX trend- following strategy would have been S240,013.89 , assuming a fully invested strategy, reinvestment of profits, no transactions costs and no taxes.

System close drawdown 1 is the largest decline in the cumulative equity line below the initial investment; based on closed-out positions only: System open drawdown (SODD) is the largest decline in the cumulative equity line below the initial investment when a position is open.

The Profit/Loss Index is a complex calculation that relates the Amount of Winning Trades to the Amount of Losing Trades on a scale of 100 (worst possible performance) to 100 (best possible performance) , with zero representing profits equal to losses. Reward/Risk Index is the Total net profit minus 1 System open drawdown. The resulting difference is then divided by the Total net profit: The Buy/Hold Indexis the Total net profit minus the buy-and-hold strategy's net profit: resulting difference is then divided by the buy-and-hold net profit: In this exercise, initial equity is assumed to be $100_ Both long and short positions are taken unless otherwise noted: Trades are executed at the closing price on the signal date.

Lane's Stochastics is a short-term price velocity in- dicator; precisely defined and successfully popularized by George C. Lane (Invest- ment Educators, PO Box 2354, Des Plaines, IL) Because Stochastics is based on a fixed period-to-period moving calculation that can jump around erratically due solely to data for the oldest period being dropped off the calculation as the data window (pe- riod of predefined length) moves   forward in time, Lane's  Stochastics is twice smoothed by moving averages Lane'$ Stochastics may be calculated, as follows: K = 100 ((C _ L) / (H - L)) where K = the location of the current price relative to the recent range. C = the latest closing of the stock or contract L = the n-period low of the stock or contract. H = the n-period high price of the stock O contract. n can be any number (Lane suggests 5 to 21 days). Next; Lane smoothes K twice with 3-period simple moving averages: his %K is the 3-period simple moving average of K,and %D is the 3-period simple moving av- erage of %K. After smoothing the data, K has no further use. Only the %K and %D lines are used for interpretation of signals. Lane offers several guidelines for interpretation of Stochastics, including over - boughtloversold preconditions, divergences, and crossovers. First, consider buy sig- nals. In a downward price move, a precondition for a buy signal is recognized when %K becomes oversold below 25%. It is more significant when %K is extremely over- sold below 15%. Note that these are only preconditions and not signals for action: After an oversold precondition has been achieved, look for positive diver- gence_ When moves down to a new low but the already oversold %K does not make a new low, this is a positive divergence, and we should be on alert for an upturn in the trend. The actual signal comes when %K crosses above %D. Lane says that the signal is more reliable when %D has already turned up when %K crosses above %D. If the slower %D has been quietly carving out a pattern of higher lows as makes lower lows, that is all the more reason to look for a buying op- portunity on the next decline. Considering sell signals, in a upward price move, a precondition for a sell sig- nal is recognized when %K becomes overbought above 759. It is more significant when %K is extremely overbought above 859. Note that these are only preconditions and not signals for action. price price price price price buy buy price Stochastics (Lane's Stochastics) 665 After an overbought precondition has been achieved, look for a negative diver- gence_ When price moves up to a new high but the already overbought %K does not make a new high, this is a negative divergence, and we should be on alert for a down- turn in the price trend. The actual sell signal comes when %K crosses below %D. Lane says that the sell signal is more reliable when %D has already turned down when %K crosses below %D. If the slower %D has been quietly carving out a pattern of lower highs as makes higher highs, that is all the more reason to look for a selling opportunity on the next rally: Lane finds additional significance in failures: For example, following an over- bought precondition, when %K has already crossed under %D, then %K rallies and re-approaches %D, but %K fails to cross above %D, that is a time to enter trade on the short side. Similarly, after a drop to an oversold precondition and minor upward reaction causing %K to cross above %D, when %K falls and re-ap- proaches %D, but %K fails to cross under %D, that is a time t0 enter a trade on the side. Lane analyzes the velocity of the %K and %D lines, and finds implications of trend change. A warning is given when %K makes an extreme turn and an unusually move. This indicates at most two days remaining in the old trend. When velocity slows; that is, when the of either the %K or %D lines flat- tens out, it indicates a price reversal on the next day. Lane calls this a Lane says reliability is enhanced when %K is in an extreme overbought Or over- sold zone: for signals, %K is extremely oversold below 15%; for sell signals, %K is extremely overbought above 85%. The most extreme %K levels near 100% and 0% indicate unusually powerful price velocity that is likely to continue in the prevailing trend direction. At times, %K can be nailed to 100% or 0% for many consecutive in a strong move. Only after %K back; tries again, but then fails to achieve its previous extreme reading does Lane recognize a worthwhile overboughtloversold precondition for a signal. It is most important to note that Lane considers signals to be more reliable when they are in the same direction as the major trend. This implies that short-term Sto- chastics could be used with major trend indicators to filter its signals. Indicator Strategy Example for Stochastics Stochastics require experience and judgement to use as George Lane intended. His guidelines are too complex for simple computer testing: Still, even naive testing as- sumptions suggest that Stochastics may have value as a purely mechanical indicator: Our tests found a majority of profitable signals, and results would have been robust for all %K lengths from 4 to 50 price again good price price again good long large speed hinge. buy days pulls period days. 666 Technical Market Indicators As attractive as a high percentage of profitable trades may seem, however; it is important to note that this and other contra-trend strategies failed to provide any prO- tection in the Crash of '87, the decline of 1998 and other steep market price drops. As the chart shows, there are sharp equity drawdowns. Using Stochastics for contra-trend oversold and overbought signals would have outperformed the passive buy-and-hold strategy for trades only: Short selling would not have been profitable in the past: Based on a merged file of adjusted daily data for the entire history of the S&P 500 Stock Index Futures CSI Perpetual Contract www.csidata.com) from inception on 4/21/82 to 5/10/01, and cash S&P 500 Stock Price Index from 11/28/80 to 4/21/82, we found that the following parameters would have produced a significantly positive result on a counter-trend_ mechanical overboughtloversold signal basis with no sub- jectivity, no sophisticated technical analysis, and no judgement: Enter Long (Buy) at the current daily close of the S&P 500 Stock Index Futures CSI Perpetual Contract when %K Stochastic with K equal to seven and smoothed by a 3-day SMA is less than 30.

Stock Market Price Indexes Price indexes are important for judging trends and measuring performance for the stock market in general. And, thanks to innovations over the past two decades; we can now and sell futures, options, trusts, and mutual funds constructed to match many of the most popular indexes. These new financial instruments are useful for specula- tors who want to "play the market" but do not have the time to conduct research on individual stocks. Indexes also offer the advantage of diversification over a large number of stocks, which reduces risk: The oldest and most indexes are those published by Dow Jones Co_ Founder Charles Dow published his first market average on July 3, 1884,in his Cus- tomer $ Afternoon Letter; the predecessor to The Wall Street Journal. This first group of stocks was comprised of 11 stocks, 9 railroads and 2 industrials. rapid rising: days: rising: price buy popular Stock Market Price Indexes 675 On May 26, 1896, Dow published his first Dow Jones Industrial Average (also commonly referred to as the Dow or the DJIA), composed solely of 12 Industrials. On October 1 1928, the Dow was expanded to 30 stocks, and it has remained at that number ever since. The component stocks have changed many times over the years, however; because of mergers, bankruptcies, and companies and whole industries ris- ing and falling in economic power: The publisher tries to maintain a current list of 30 of the largest and most important blue-chip stocks. The only two names recognizable from 1928 are General Electric and General Motors_ Given current trends to- ward increasingly competitive financial capitalism and accelerating technological change, we might expect even more frequent changes of component stock issues in ahead. The current list of stocks included in the Dow Averages can be found each on page C3 of The Wall Street Journal. For all practical purposes, the DJIA is remarkably representative of the general market. The 30 Dow stocks comprise only about 159 of the total market value of all U.S. stocks. Critics have doubted that such a small sample could adequately rep- resent the whole stock market; which is comprised of many thousands of stocks. And it is obvious that the Dow and the broader market sometimes go their separate ways for a while Also, in the words of Arthur A. Merrill, CMT; a professional statistician as well as an expert technical market analyst; "Statisticians wince when they learn the weighting method" of the Dow-Jones averages. The arithmetic price average is price weighted, so a $100 stock has 10 times the influence of a $10 stock. Worse, if a stock splits two-for-one, its weight immediately drops in half: Finally, substitutions of stocks in the averages also have detracted from comparability of the averages to themselves over time. But despite these reasonable criticisms, statistics clearly show that the Dow Averages reflect the trends of the broad market very closely: Looking at it with a microscope, we have noticed over the years a somewhat greater number of false signals (misleading breakouts and breakdowns) with the DJIA than with the better constructed indexes such as the Standard Poor' s or NYSE composites. In fact, when the DJIA diverges from the S&P 500, the DJIA is usually the one that proves to be wrong That is why most technical analysts chart more than one general price index: The Dow-Jones Transportation and Utility Averages suffer from the same weak- nesses as the DJIA ~price weighting, splits, substitutions, and small sample size (only 20 transportation stocks and 15 utilities). Takeover speculation in only one O two transportation equities can have a significant effect on the average. In 1980, when energy stocks were dominating the market; most of the utility average'$ movements were directly attributable to four natural gas stocks, rather than the staid electric util- ity equities most people think of when consider the utility average Contrary to popular opinion, we' ve found that the Dow-Jones Transportation Average is not a reliable leading indicator for the general market  But the Dow-Jones today years day long they 676 Technical Market Indicators Utility Average is a fairly reliable leading indicator more often than not; although the lead may be and variable. The broad-based, capitalization-weighted Standard Poor's (S&P) indexes and NYSE price indexes are measures of total market value. The most recent price of the hundreds of component stocks are multiplied by the number of shares outstanding: This product is then divided by a base date index number to make the index compa- rable over time. Splits have no impact, and substitutions of stocks are properly han- dled by adjusting the base date index number: Thus, valid and comparable market data are available all the way back to 1873 for the S&P 500. The NYSE Composite (symbol NYA) is composed of all 2,800 common stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The NYA includes about 829 of the total market value of all U.S. stocks The S&P Composite Index of the 500 biggest stocks (symbol SPX) is a subset of the NYSE Composite, and it comprises about 65% of the total market value of all U.S. stocks. The S&P 100 (OEX) index, used as the market index for a Chicago Board Options Exchange contract; is a subset of the S&P 500, the 100 largest stocks. As one might guess, there is a near perfect correlation between these capitalization-weighted indexes, all of which have the bulk of their weight in the 100 largest stocks The NASDAQ Composite (symbol COMP) is composed of 5500 unlisted stocks traded over-the-counter; and it comprises about 18% of the total market value of all U.S. stocks. The NASDAQ Technology Stock Index of 700 stocks is a subset of the COMP and it comprises about 379 of the total market value of the COMP NASDAQ stands for the National Association of Securities Dealers Automatic Quo- tation The American Stock Exchange (AMEX) Market Value Index is properly capi- talization weighted, but its entire capitalization does not match that of only one stock; IBM, so its significance is minuscule. Moreover; only 10 stocks account for about one third of the AMEX total weight, so distortions are possible. Few technical ana- lysts follow the AMEX index. The Russell 3000 stock index is composed of 3000 common stocks, and it com- about 98% of the total market value of all U.S. stocks. A subset;, the Russell 1000 stock index, is the top third of the 3000 in terms of market capitalization. The Russell 1000 comprises about 909 of the total market value of the Russell 3000. The Russell 2000 stock index, which is the bottom two-thirds of the Russell 3000 in mar- ket capitalization, comprises about 10% of the total market value of the Russell 3000. The Wilshire  5000 stock index is the most broadly based, capitalization- weighted index, comprising almost all of the total market value of all U.S. stocks Originally composed of 5000 stocks, this index now covers approximately 7,000 U.S. equities, including all actively trading common stocks on the New York Stock Ex- change, American Stock Exchange, and NASDAQ over-the-counter dealer market. long price listing system. price prises Stock Market Price Indexes 677 The Value Line Averages are unweighted geometric averages of 1665 stocks. The smallest stock has the same impact as the largest. According to Norman G. Fos- back, in his 1976 book Stock Market Logic (Institute for Econometric Research, 3471 North Federal  Highway, Fort  Lauderdale, FL 33306), the geometric  averaging method (based on logarithms results in a negative, downward bias, So that the geo- metric average is always below the simple arithmetic average O mean We have not found the Value Line composite useful in Our technical work Fosback is also critical of the advance-decline line as market barometer; for three very reasons First, no consideration is given to the extent of or mar- ket value change, but only to the direction of price change, up O down: Academic studies have proven that average advances are larger than average de- clines, so the advance-decline line's failure to take into account the size of any change means that the advance-decline must underperform the stock market in- dexes, which it does. Second, the number of listed stocks has increased over the years, thus destroying the comparability of the advance-decline line over time. (This can be adjusted for by dividing advances minus declines by advances plus declines O by total issues traded ) Third, inclusion of preferred stocks, which fluctuate more with bond prices than with common stock prices, produces distortions, particularly when bond prices and common stock prices are trending in opposite directions, as ten have in the past: Given these substantial shortcomings, false divergences in the advance-decline line versus price indexes become more understandable. On the positive side, Fosback holds unweighted total return indexes in high re- These are based on Quotron's *QCHA, which is the average percentage change for each common stock listed on the NYSE. Including dividend return as well as percentage change gives a more realistic overall representation, according to Fosback; because more than half of the long-term total return of all common stocks through history has been from dividends. Although Fosback has made a case for unweighted, total return indexes, still do not enjoy wide popularity. For one thing, the big institutions have diffi- culty trading large dollar amounts of small capitalization stocks, so mostly stay with the big, high-capitalization stocks that dominate the S&P 500. Thus, focus on that index. For another unweighted total return indexes are not widely lished in the popular press, and few people choose to spend the time necessary to make their own calculations In conclusion, like most technical researchers, we prefer the broad-based, capi- talization-weighted indexes for our technical studies, specifically the S&P 500 Or NYSE Composite, which for practical purposes are nearly the same We use the Dow for many studies for the very practical reason that we happen to have the most daily data in computer readable form (back to 1900) for the Dow Finally, the weight of dition favoring the DJIA is and demands respect: good price price price price price of- they gard. price price good they they they thing; pub- tra- heavy 678 Technical Market Indicators Support and Resistance At the most basic level, Support and Resistance are previous lows and highs. Price movements have a tendency to halt O at least react o hesitate at the previous lows and highs that stand out on the chart as obviously significant Also, the sloping trend- lines and price channels that contain the action within orderly ascending O de- scending patterns   offer moving points of Support and Resistance that   function similarly to horizontal ranges_ A very useful property of Support and Resistance is the tendency of these levels to reverse roles once penetrated. Specifically, once a Support level below the current is broken, that level becomes Resistance on future rally attempts. Similarly, once a Resistance level above the current is broken, that level becomes Support on future downward corrections_ The chart example of Texas Instruments shows that the 1.4 to 1.8 zone of sup- port held all declines for 11 years from 1980 to 1991. The resistance around 3.5 to 3.7 , encountered in 1983, 1988, and early 1993, reversed roles and functioned as sup- port in late 1993. Also, the 1987-1994 resistance in the 5 to 5.5 zone reversed roles and functioned as support on three separate occasions in 1996. The very long; 15-year sideways trading range from 1980 to 1995 functioned as a powerful base of accumu- lation for a major price markup to 99.8 in 2000. Inquiring minds always want to know why, of course, so here is a rationale, best illustrated by an example. Suppose a stock has been trading in a range of 50 to 55 for several months. Active followers of the stock have taken notice, so on dips to Support at 50 then sell and short on rallies to Resistance at 55,a profitable business strategy. But orderly patterns do not last forever; and one the price slices through 50 and closes at 48. The next it drops two more points. The third day it falls an- other point to 45. By this time, swing traders who bought at 50 and did not do the right and cut their loss quickly are down 10% and, consequently, are in a dys- functional psychological state. hope for a rally back to their at 50. If can only their money back will get out even. This is bad trading strat- egy, of course, but it is human nature to hate to be to feel on to be slow to admit mistakes, and to hope for a lucky break that will allow them to undo their So if the stock does bounce back to 50,all those suffering buyers hoping to get their money back will be relieved and to offer their stock positions for sale at that 50 level, thereby putting a lid on the and creating a resistance level that is hard for the stock to overcome. Also, bears, who covered shorts at 50 be- cause it seemed like the end of a trading range, now would be to reestab- lish short positions at 50 if get the chance. Similarly, on the upside, following a 50 to 55 trading range followed by a penetration of Resistance at 55 and a run to 60, the short sellers at 55 are now hoping price trading price price price they buy day - day; thing They buy price they they get pain losing, - wrong; pain. happy long price lower happy they long 17.5 17.0  16.51 16_ 15.5 Texas Instruments (TXN) -Triangle 15.0 From 1980 to 1994, TXN Continuation 14.5 slowly built a Compound Fulcrum Base; 14.0 which can be seen only on very long-term charts 13.5 It was a lauching for a major move 13.0 12.5 to 99.8 on 3/6/2000_ 12.0 Notice that Resistance, 11.57 once penetrated, 11.0 became Support: 10.57 First 10.02 upside 9.5 objective 9.0 met at 8.6. 8.5 7.5 Gap; 7.0 Breakaway 6.5 Resistance 5.5 5.0 Test of Support 4.5 Resistance 4.0 3.5 Support 3.0 2.5 2.0 Years of Support 1Ato L8 1.5 100000 so00o| Mh E1q 1980 198- 11982 7983 '1984 {i985 41986 11987 '1988 M1g89" I1990' {1991 {1992 {1993' {1994 1995 {1996 {1997 {1998' 8 pad 680 Technical Market Indicators for a downward price correction so they can reduce their losses and their psycholog- ical discomfort at wrong They will be willing buyers at 55, their break-even point: Also, bulls on the stock who did not short but did take profits at 55, feel re- morse at the potential profit missed. These bulls also hope for a correction to 55, where sold SO can undo their mistake and get another chance to reestablish their positions Thus, both groups, the bulls and the bears, will be bidding for the stock at 55, providing support: Swing Filter major challenge to traders is how to deal with noise in the data generated by free markets. There are many conceptually related techniques that attempt to filter out mi- nor movements, O ripples in Dow Theory terminology: Some simply ignore price movements less than a certain minimum size. The Point and Figure Charting method is an ancient and well-known example of such a filter: Swing Filter is a simple idea: examine each high and low and filter out price re- versals under a minimum percentage size. For example, some stock market analysts filter out and (thus ignore) movements of less than 3% or 4% 0r &9. This cuts down on the amount of data to be considered, simplifying the decision-making process. The idea is that if we can cut out some of the minor noise, we can reduce the confusion and better focus on the main trend. The optimal size of the filter can be determined by back testing: example of a Swing Filter is a slightly asymmetrical rule developed more than 12 years ago by Ned Davis Research. Buy the S&P 500 Index when it rises from an extreme closing low by 8.4%. Hold until the S&P 500 Index falls from an extreme closing high by 7.29 , then sell long positions and switch into Commercial Paper: This simple filter would have given profitable signals 639 of the time, for long trades only: It would have outperformed a passive buy-and-hold strat- egy by 44.29 from 1969 to 1998,as the chart shows This Swing Filter rule is always on the right side of the big moves, has a built-in, loss-cutting stop loss point; and has an average four times larger than its average loss. being they they long; painful they long price price good price long price price gain Weekly Data 7/1971968 872472001 (Log Scale) Standard & Poor' s 500 Stock Index % Reversals 1598 Profitable Trades: 56 % 1598 1462 Gain/Annum 11.5 % 1462 1338 Buy-Hold Gain/Annum 7.9 % 1338 1225 Latest Signal 7/06/2001 1190.59 1225 1121 S = Switch into ComnercialPaper 1121 1026 Signal Dates: 2/19/1969 8/24/2001 1026 939 939 859 859 786 786 719 719 658 658 603 603 551 551 505 505 462 An 8.4% Rise From 462 423 8/17/2001 Low 423 387 of 1161.97 1259.58 387 354 354 8/24/2001 1184.93 324 324 297 297 271 271 248 248 227 227 208 208 190 190 174 174 159 159 146 146 134 134 122 8 122 112 112 102 102 94 94 86 B B 86 Signals Generated When S&P 500: 78 Rises by 8.4 % 78 72 1 Falls by 7.2% Sell 72 66 66 60 60 TTaTTTTTT Mmuc MMmaat (S105) @ E 8 0 2 8 8 2 18 8 WJ 0 8 Chart by permission of Ned Davis Research: Long Buy 682 Technical Market Indicators Swing Index (Wilder's) Wilder s Swing Index (SI) is a complex trend-confirmation/divergence indicator lished by J. Welles Wilder; Jr,, in his 1978 book; New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems (Trend Research, PO Box 128, McLeansville, NC 27301). Wilder designed SI to be a better representation of the true market trend. SI compares relationships be- tween the current prices (open, high, low, and close) and the previous S prices. Mathematically, SI may be expressed as follows: SI = 50 * K)/M ) * ((C _ Cp) + 5 (C _ 0) + .25(Cp Op)) / R ) where K = the larger of H _ Cp o L Cp. H = the highest price of the current period. Cp the closing price of the previous period. L = the lowest price of the current period. M = the value of a limit move set by the futures exchange. C = the closing of the current period. 0 = the opening of the current period. Op the opening of the previous period: R is defined by the following two steps: 1: Determine which is the largest of the following three values: H _ Cp, or L Cp, or H - L Step 2: Calculate R according to one of following three formulas: If the largest value in is H _ Cp, then R = (H - Cp) _ S( L _ C) + .25(Cp _ Op). If the largest value in Step 1 is L _ Cp, then R = (L - Cp) -  S( H - C) + .25(Cp Op). If the largest value in 1is H _ L; then R = (H - L) + 25(Cp Op). pub- period' price price price Step Step Step Swing Retracement Levels 683 Stocks   do not have daily movement  limits.  Therefore, when MetaStock( software, we use the maximum number of 30,000 for the 'limit move parameter: The SI data can be plotted as an oscillator viewed with a variety of technical analysis methods. It is most productively viewed as the Accumulation Swing Index (ASI), which is cumulative running total of the Swing Index. (See Accumulation Swing Index: Swing Retracement Levels This Swing Retracement method subtracts the extreme low from the extreme high of any significant swing (price range) , multiplies that difference by certain customary numbers used by the trading community, then adds these products to the extreme low and subtracts them from the extreme high: The results are useful price targets as well as support and resistance levels. W. D. Gann divided a price range into eighths: 0.125, 0.25, 0.375, 0.5, 0.625, 0.75, 0.875, and 1. Gann also projected whole number integer multiples of a range: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7, 8,9, 10,etc. Gann marked off squares of integers: 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, etc. Gann also used the range from the extreme high price down to zero_ And independent of any past prices, Gann noted numbers, especially those followed by zeros_ The most important Fibonacci ratios to multiply the past price ranges by are: 0.236, 0.382, 0.500, 0.618, 0.786, 1.000, 1.272, 1.618,2.000,2.618, and 4.236. Dow Theorists emphasize thirds, that is, 0.333 and 0.667. Tubb's Law of Proportion emphasizes common fractions, 1/2 or 0.5, 2/3 or 0.667, and 3/4 or 0.75,as the most important ratios. This Swing Retracement method also may be applied to time intervals between swing highs and lows For example, if a upswing lasted 100 calendar from the date of the low to the date of the high, we might look for a downward correction of that up-move to terminate at or near the following Fibonacci num- bers of days from the top, rounded to whole numbers: 24, 38, 50, 62, 79, 100, 127, 162, 200, 262, and 424 calendar Finally, to cover all bases, we could mark off the thirds, 33 and 66 and all the Gann numbers. To the uninitiated, unaware of the market's hidden structures, this exercise may seem arbitrary and illogical at first. But many experienced traders employ Swing Re- tracement because it often helps them determine in advance potential price levels and time junctures at which to be especially alert for price-trend change. use these dates and price levels in conjunction with other technical indicators to pinpoint trend changes that otherwise would be impossible to identify: On occasion, hit a future turning with uncanny accuracy: price using long price 144, round price days; price price price days. days, They they point 684 Technical Market Indicators Taylor Book Method The Taylor Book Method is a short-term, contrary, trend-fading strategy that attempts to capitalize on an observed tendency of the markets to move in ripples of about 3 days in one direction before reversing: Basically, after three down look to any early weakness at 0r near the opening: If the market is not weak early, postpone action by a day: Look to take profits near previous daily highs.

It is named for the three line blocks used to construct the chart: This method considers closing prices only and ignores all intraday highs and lows. A new white block is added to the chart in a new column to the right when the high of the previous block is exceeded: A new black block is added when the current close breaks the low of the previous block, and this new black block is drawn in the next column to the right from the bottom of the previous block. When there is neither a new high or low, nothing is added and the chart remains the same. Thus, like the western Point and Figure Technique, movement (and not the passage of time) determines the progress the horizontal x-axis. Following rally powerful enough to form three consecutive white blocks, downside reversal is recognized only when the falls below the lowest of the most recent three consecutive white blocks At that point, from the bottom of the highest white block; black block is drawn down to this new price low. Following sell-off powerful enough to form three consecutive black blocks, an upside reversal is recognized only when the price rises above the highest price of the most recent three consecutive black blocks At that point; from the top of the lowest black block, a white block is drawn up to this new price high: The chart shows the Three Line Break Chart for the S&P Depositary Receipts (SPY) for the full year 2000, January through December; drawn with MetaStock" software.

Three Moving Average Crossover Three Moving Average Crossover is a combination indicator that uses three moving averages of different lengths to generate trading signals. It combines fast and slow moving average signals in one indicator: when the slope of the fast moving av- erage is positive and the medium moving average is above the slow moving average. Sell when the of the fast moving average is negative and the medium moving average is below the slow moving average. One version uses 4-, 9-, and 18- trading days for the moving average lengths These specific period lengths could be allowed to vary; of course, producing a very large number of possibilities. One possi- ble MetaStock@ System Test could be expressed as follows: Enter long: Mov(CLOSE,optl,E) > Ref(Mov(CLOSE,optl,E)-1) AND Mov(CLOSE,2*optl,E) > Mov(CLOSE,4*optl,E) Close Mov(CLOSE,optl,E) Ref(Mov(CLOSE,c ,E),-1) AND Mov(CLOSE,2*optl,E) < Mov(CLOSE,4*optl,E) Enter short: Mov(CLOSE,optl,E) Ref(Mov(CLOSE,optl,E),-1) AND Mov(CLOSE,2*optl,E) < Mov(CLOSE,4*optl,E) Close short: Mov(CLOSE,optl,E) > Ref(Mov(CLOSE,optl,E)-1) AND Mov(CLOSE,2*optl,E) > Mov(CLOSE,4*optl,E) TICK TICK is a snapshot of the market'$ trend at any specific time in the trading TICK reflects market strength (positive and rising) or weakness (negative and falling) at any moment during the trading day TICK is the net difference between the number of NYSE stocks with their latest sales occurring on an (a higher current than the next most recent price) minus the number of NYSE stocks with last sales occUI - on downtick (a lower current than the previous price).

It can be interpreted in standard oscillator fashion. Traders watch TICK to identify shifts in trends. When TICK goes from a large negative reading to a positive reading, that indicates a bullish change in the mar- ket's demand and supply balance. Similarly, an equally dramatic negative swing, from a big plus TICK to a big minus TICK, indicates a bearish Buy slope popular long: optl_ day: uptick price ring price price price. large - change. TICK 687 Positive and negative divergences in TICK relative to an independent indicator; such as a market price index, indicate an impending trend change. When TICK makes a series of lower highs while an independent market indicator makes higher highs, such a negative divergence warns of a possible bearish change in the prevail- ing trend. Similarly, when TICK makes a series of higher lows while an independent market indicator makes lower lows, such positive divergence warns of a possible bullish change in the prevailing trend. Generally, extremely high TICK readings indicate extremely positive momen- tum and unusual market strength: Such a strong trend often continues until momen- tum starts to dissipate on rallies. Some very aggressive short-term professional traders fade extreme momentum, expecting a return to more normal conditions. Generally, counter-trend trading tactics are not appropriate for long-term investors. Extremely low TICK readings indicate unusual selling pressure. Again, it is risky to fade such momentum, but the best time to buck that negative trend is when there is a genuine Selling Climax on huge volume. Such a Selling Climax is often fol- lowed by an unsustainable Dead Cat Bounce that can be profitable for astute traders. TICK has larger implications beyond day trading: The last price of the the closing price, has long been regarded as the single most important price of the The daily tug of war between bulls and bears is settled at one at the end of the When all is said and done at day'$ end, that closing price is where demand and supply balance. The close is a summary of the day's activity: Technicians usually ap- ply various moving averages to closing TICK values to smooth out erratic move- ments and reveal any underlying trend. (We added 10,000 to closing TICK to avoid the more complicated handling negative numbers, So our graph oscillates around 10,000.)

Time Segmented Volume (TSV) 691 Tick Volume Bar Tick Volume Bar is a bar chart with price on the vertical y-axis and n-tick intervals on the horizontal x-axis. Each price bar is defined by n number of ticks For example, tick volume bar of 10 would contain the price range measured over the past 10 transactions, a tick volume bar of 100 would contain the range measured over the past 100 transactions, and so on. Time Segmented Volume (TSV) Time Segmented Volume (TSV) is a proprietary and volume oscillator created by Don Worden (www. TC2OOO.com, Worden Brothers, Inc. 4950 Pine Cone Drive, Durham, North Carolina 27707, phone 800 776 4940). Worden typically uses an 18-, 26-, or 31-bar TSV; with the shorter the time period the more sensitive, and the longer the time period the less sensitive. Next; Worden smoothes this TSV data with an exponential moving average (of 13-days in his published example), which he over - on the TSV Worden has observed that TSV works better for some stocks than others, so he evaluates past performance of TSV for each stock to see how well TSV applies on a case by case basis: TSV is interpreted much the same as any other oscillator: it is examined in a va- riety of ways to determine the relative balance of accumulation (buying) and distrib- ution (selling) and the implied potential for sustained directional price movement The oscillator is measured for its level relative to its own r ecent range, with high levels bullish and low levels bearish: The relative levels of the oscillator are compared to the rela tive levels of the raw price data to determine any positive Or negative divergences between the two The oscillator is compared to a critical threshold level, in t his case the zero line. Above the threshold is bullish: Below the threshold is bearish: The oscillator' s own exponential moving average is compared to the critical threshold level. Above the threshold is bullish: Below the threshold is bear- ish: The oscillator is compared to its own past trend, which in thi S case is de- fined by its own trailing exponential moving average. Above trend is bull- ish: Below trend is bearish: In contrast to many oscillators, TSV is not used to determine 0 verbought and oversold levels. price price lays 692 Technical Market Indicators When these criteria line up 0n one side, bullish or bearish; the implications for action are clear; and the stock is bought o sold. When the criteria are mixed, subtle judgements are called for: Time Series Forecast (TSF); Moving Linear Regression, End Point Moving Average (EPMA) Time Series Forecast (TSF) is the ending value of a Linear Regression trendline plus its slope. The addition of extends the Linear Regression trendline forward in time by one trading offering a naive forecast of the next day'$ This as - sumes the trend continues in linear fashion (which it seldom does). TSF is designed to up trend change signals by reducing TSF tracks the raw data more closely than Linear Regression trendlines or moving averages. The term ~End Point Moving Average' is a misnomer, strictly speaking, be- cause this indicator is not computed like a moving average. But Patrick E. Lafferty "The End Point Moving Average" Technical Analysis of Stocks & Commodities, V13, pages 413-417_ wwWtraders_com) , correctly pointed out that this indicator could be interpreted much the same as moving averages He suggested a signal when TSF moves up and the value of the DJIA is higher than the value of the TSF He suggested a sell signal when TSF moves down and the value of the DJIA is lower than the value of the TSF Total Issues Traded Total issues traded includes all of the issues that traded at all on any given day, in- cluding the total number of stocks ending the higher; lower; and unchanged. On the NYSE, total issues traded rose 10809 from 1940 to 1999. Such growth distorts the meaning of breadth (advances, declines, new highs, and new lows) indicators over time. (See Number of Total Issues Traded. _ Total Short Ratio The Total Short Ratio is calculated by dividing total short sales by total volume. Monthly NYSE data is used. High readings reflect excessive shorting and are viewed as bullish: Low readings signify low levels of shorting and are considered bearish: (See Short Interest Ratio:, slope day; price. speed lag: buy day Trailing Reversal Trading System 693 Total Win Trade %, the Trader's Advantage The Trader's Advantage is the Total Winning Trade Percentage, or "Total Win Trade % in our tables. This is the number of profitable trades divided by the total number of trades This statistic is generally accorded far more attention than it deserves. Many trend-following indicators that work well in terms of outperforming Re- ward/Risk benchmarks, because cut losses and let profits run, actually have atively low Total Winning Trade Percentages. In contrast; some indicators that work poorly in terms of underperforming Reward/Risk benchmarks actually have relatively high Total Winning Trade Percentages In practical terms, Total Win Trade % is unim- portant relative to Reward/Risk considerations, which deserve most of our attention. Trap: Bull Bear Trap A occurs when breaks out above a resistance level or below a support level but then immediately reverses with forceful move in the opposite direction: This traps or hooks trend-followers who went with the breakout: These trend-followers must now cut losses, which adds fuel to the new directional momentum. The result- fast move is of interest to short-term traders. A Bull is an breakout followed by a fast and violent reversal to the downside. A Bear Trap is a downside breakout followed by a fast and violent reversal to the upside. are quite com- mon and significant in short-term trading but are of little importance to long-term in- vesting: A Trap is also known as a Springboard. Trailing Reversal Trading System The Trailing Reversal Trading System enters long trade when the stock price rises percent from a recent Pivot Point Low. The sells and sells short when the stock falls n percent from a recent Pivot Point High. The oly variable, percent, depends on preferred time frame and trading frequency: Typically this per- centage may vary from 1% to 59 for traders up to 79 to 159 for investors_ (See Swing Filter; on page 680.) good they re]- Trap, Trap price ing Trap upside Traps long system price 694 Technical Market Indicators Trend Channel The Trend Channel is composed of two parallel lines moving forward in time. These two parallel lines contain most or all price fluctuations The Trend Channel may slope upward or downward_ A sideways trading range is a horizontal Trend Channel, also known as a Price Channel. Once we have established a Trendline through at least two of the more recent price pivot extremes, we may draw a parallel line through intervening extreme prices in the opposite direction. This Channel Line can be used for setting price objectives for trading within the trend. Both the basic trendline and the parallel Trend Channel offer reasonable estimates of the limits of future swings moving forward in time. All things must eventually come to an end: When the moves outside the boundaries of the Channel, that signals new and more forceful momentum It could mean either trend acceleration (if price breaks out in the direction of the pre- vailing trend) O trend reversal (if price breaks out in the opposite direction to the pre- vailing trend). In either case, we assume that the balance of demand and supply is shifting for the financial instrument analyzed: The new objective would be the width of the recent Channel plus Or minus the breakout point Following a period when prices have been contained within a Channel, when the price moves toward one boundary but fails to reach it by a substantial margin, that may signal a change in momentum and a shift in the balance of demand and supply: The technical analyst goes on alert for a trend which would be confirmed by an actual break of the Trend Channel. Trendlines, Trend Lines Trendlines are a basic tool of technical analysis are simple to define and to draw on any chart; bar; candlestick; and and-figure. For an uptrend line, once the has established a higher high and higher low; we can connect the lowest low with a more recent higher low Alternately; could judge that a better fit to the trend could be accomplished by using the second and third higher lows for our trendline. In either case, we start with an obvious past low that stands out on the chart, then we move our hand to the right (moving forward in time) and up (moving higher in price) to another obvious low that was higher than the first low and happened at a later date. We connect these two with a straight line. This is a tentative up trendline. When the falls and stops on that then the up trendline is confirmed as valid. It takes at least three points 0n a line to form a valid trendline. Similarly for an downtrend line, after the price has already established a high and lower low, we start with an obvious past price high that stands out on the price good price price price change, They price point-: price we price price price points price again line, lower 350 350 300 300 250- 250 200 200 150- Dow-Jones Industrial Average 150 W Example of Price Channeling: Parallel lines contain most of the price movements and offer indications of support and resistance: 100 100 1924 1925 1926 1927 1928 929 930 8 696 Technical Market Indicators chart: Next we move our hand to the right (moving forward in time) and down (mov- ing lower in price) to another obvious price high that was lower than the first high and happened at a later date. Connect these two points with a straight line. This is a tenta- tive down trendline. When the price rises and stops on that line, then the down trendline is confirmed as valid. It takes three points on a line to form a valid trendline. Horizontal trendlines drawn through obvious chart highs and lows are used to define the sideways ranges that often turn into recognizable continuation O re- versal chart patterns. trendline is generally considered to be more valid the longer it lasts (in time) and the more times the touches the trendline and holds. Again we emphasize that it takes at least three points on a line to form valid trendline. And the more touches on a trendline, the more powerful and significant that trendline is. If the trendline happens to coincide with another significant technical indicator; such as a moving average O a Gann Angle, then that trendline is more powerful. Trendlines seem to work   better on arithmetic   scale charts   for  short-to- intermediate-term analysis, covering minutes to weeks and even months. For multi- year trends, it may be more useful to use a semi-log scale, particularly if the financial instrument analyzed has had a very large move. Trident Commodity Trading System The Trident Commodity Trading System looks for equality of price swing size in the direction of the main trend. This idea is related to Trend Channel. For example, in an uptrend, if the previous upward was 10% then, after correction, we would look for the next upswing to be about 10%. Points could be used instead of percent- age moves. Trident also places emphasis on half- and quarter-size swings for support, resistance and confirmation. Triple Crossover Method The Triple Crossover Method refers to the use of three moving averages of different lengths to signal the trend. Usually, for a signal, a short-period length moving av- erage must rise above both an intermediate-term and a long-term period length mov- average. Also, the intermediate may Or may not be required to be above the long-length average. For a sell signal, the opposite conditions apply, a short-period length moving average must fall below both an intermediate-term and a long-term pe- riod length moving average. The best period lengths for each of three moving aver- ages may be found by brute-force optimization. There are a very large number of again price price price key price swing buy ing Triple Exponential Moving Averages (TEMA) 697 possible combinations of period lengths. (See Three Moving Average Crossover on page 686.) Triple Exponential Moving Averages (TEMA) Triple Exponential Moving Averages (TEMA) uses three different Exponential Mov- ing Averages (EMAs) in an effort to speed up signals and achieve a faster response to fluctuations. TEMA was introduced by Patrick G. Mulloy in 1994, Smoothing Data With Less Lag" Technical Analysis of Stocks & Commodities magazine, V. 12.2 (www.traders.com) _ TEMA uses single, double and triple EMAs. The first EMA smoothes the closing price, while the second EMA smoothes the first EMA and the third EMA smoothes the second EMA. Then, TEMAI 3EMAI 3EMA2 + EMA3. Thus, TEMAI is a composite of single, double and triple Exponential Moving Averages_ In our independent observations, at short lengths, TEMA does appear to respond more effectively to changing new data than both an ordinary EMA and Double EMA At longer period lengths, however; TEMA responds much less effectively than the equivalent length EMA As the table shows, TEMA underperformed single EMA at lengths of 29 and higher: Therefore, TEMA should not be assumed to be substitute for any other moving average. Rather; it may best be considered to be an unfamiliar new tool to be approached with appropriately cautious respect TEMA def- initely cannot be used in place of traditional moving averages without testing: price days 698 Technical Market Indicators The facing table shows a comparison of the signal performance of a standard moving average crossover rule using TEMA and an ordinary EMA of the same length, in as measured against the S&P 500 Composite Stock Price Index fu- tures CSI Perpetual Contract from 4/21/82 to 12/29/00. The data reflects trades only: It is apparent that TEMA would have been a more efficient signal generator than an ordinary EMA at very short time period lengths but much less effective at longer time period lengths of more than 28 Indicator Strategy Example for TEMA Based on 18-year file of daily data for the entire history of the S&P 500 Composite Stock Price Index futures CSI Perpetual Contract WWW.csidata.com) from 4/21/82 to 12/29/00, we found that the following parameters would have produced a positive result on a purely mechanical signal basis with no subjectivity, no sophisticated tech- nical analysis, and no judgement: Enter Long (Buy) at the current daily close of the S&P 500 Com- posite Stock Price Index futures CSI Perpetual Contract when that price close is greater than the 6-day TEMA, signifying a short-term up- trend. Close (Sell) at the current daily price close of the S&P 500 Com- posite Stock Price Index futures CSI Perpetual Contract when that price close is less than the 6-day TEMA, signifying a short-term down- trend. Enter Short (Sell Short) never: Starting with $100 and reinvesting profits, total net profits for this TEMA trend- following strategy would have been S815.33,assuming a fully invested strategy, rein- vestment of profits, no transactions costs and no taxes. This would have been 21.19 percent less than buy-and-hold. No short selling would have been profitable, and no short selling was included in the strategy. This long-only TEMA would have given profitable signals 46.979 of the time. Trading would have been very active at one trade every 7.67 calendar days.

With Triple Screen, Elder three screens before he accepts a trade: long-term trend- following indicator; a short-term contra-trend indicator; and a very short-term trend- following indicator: All  three   indicators must be before a transaction is warranted_ Elder suggests a weekly MACD Histogram direction (rising is bullish, falling is bearish) as a longer term permission filter: trades may be entered only in harmony with that. When weekly MACDH is only trades may be initiated. When weekly MACDH is falling, only short trades may be entered. (See Indicator Seasons: Triple Screen trades contrary to a daily overboughtloversold 0 scillator: El- der suggests his Force Index; Elder-Ray; or Stochastics to generate these signals. When the daily oscillator is oversold and weekly MACDH is only long trades may be initiated. When the daily oscillator is overbought and weekly MACDH is falling, only short trades may be initiated. Finally, Triple Screen enters positions in harmony with intrad ay breakouts. For example, when the high today moves above the high of the ous assuming the first two conditions have already been met: Sell short when the low today moves below the low of the previous assum- ing the first two conditions have already been met. TRIX (triple exponential smoothing of the log of closing price) TRIX is a price momentum oscillator introduced by Jack K Hutson, "Good Trix' Technical Analysis of Stocks Commodities magazine, V: 1:5, (www.traders.com). TRIX is the 1-day difference of the triple exponential smoothing of the of closing computed in six steps: 1. Compute the of the daily close. 2. Smooth the with an exponential moving average (EMA) 3. Compute an EMA of the EMA from Step 2_ 4 Compute an EMA of the EMA from Step 3. 5. Compute   the difference  between  each day'$  utput of the third smoothing; that is, subtract the result of 4 today from the result of 4 the previous 6.

Welles Wilder; Jr,, in his 1978 book, New Concepts in Technical Trading Sys- tems (Trend Research; PO Box 128, McLeansville, NC 27301), defined True Range as the largest value of the following three possibilities: T=H-L T =A=P T =P -L where T = True Range. H = the highest price of the current period. L the lowest price of the current period. P the closing price of the previous period. Wilder defined Average True Range (ATR) as a exponential smoothing (O1 ex- ponential moving average) of True Range. Most frequently, Wilder used examples with an exponential smoothing constant of 1/14,or 0.07143, which is roughly alent to 27-day simple moving average. For his Volatility Index, Wilder uses an ex- ponential smoothing constant of 1/7, O 0.14286, which is roughly equivalent to a 13-day simple moving average. 25-Day Plurality Index The 25-Day Plurality Index is a market breadth indicator designed to show when the market is either active and on the move (extremely high readings) or complacent and nothing (extremely low readings). It is calculated in four steps: 1. Subtract the number of declining issues from the number of advancing issues each 2 Convert that difference to an absolute value by throwing away the sign, plus Or minus. 3. Add together these absolute values for the past 25 days. 4 Repeat Steps 1, 2 and 3 each day to maintain a moving total of the absolute differences between advances and declines. Gaps Gaps equiv- doing day: 25-Day Plurality Index 707 Traditionally, NYSE data is used in the calculation; but it might be adapted to data from other exchanges. Absolute value ignores sign; plus Or minus. So, for example, if the day'$ market movement is moderately bullish, with the number of advancing issues 1500 and the number of declining issues 1300, the day's 25-day Plurality Index input before sum- mation is 200. On the other hand; if the next day'$ market trend is reversed to moder- ately bearish, with the number of advancing issues 1300 and the number of declining issues 1500, the day's input still equals 200, because absolute value only counts the difference without regard to whether the imbalance is to the advancing or declining side. In contrast most other breadth indicators assign a plus sign to advances and a mi- nus sign to declines, and retain the sign: The graph shows that the levels of the 25-day Plurality Index have been in- creasing over time. The number of total issues traded on the NYSE grew 1080% over 59 years, from a low of 303 on 8/24/40 to a high of 3574 on 11/30/99. This growth can distort the meaning of a breadth indicator over time. The technical analyst must adapt, and we could convert this indicator to a percentage of the absolute value of net advances minus declines divided by total issues traded. See Absolute Breadth Index: Alternately, we could measure the 25-day Plurality Index against its own Bollinger Bands, which are adaptive envelops that automatically adjust to changes in levels over time_ The interesting observation behind the 25-day Plurality Index is that when the absolute difference between the number of advancing and declining stocks is ex- tremely high; the market is more likely to be near bottom. Significant market lows are often more extreme, more intensely emotional, with most stocks affected by general pessimism; fear; and forced selling to meet margin calls. Prices are changing for most stocks near market bottom: Conversely, when the absolute difference between the number of advancing and declining stocks is low, the market is more likely to be near market top. Significant market tops are more likely to be dull, slowly unfolding affairs, as ready cash reserves for buying stock are gradually drawn down until are eventually ex- hausted. Stock uptrends begin to stall out on an issue by issue basis, one by one, and the whole topping process stretches out over time. As the bull market wears out and the demand and supply for stock reaches equilibrium, stock prices are likely to be mixed. Indicator Strategy Example for the 25-Day Plurality Index: The Old Standards are Obsolete The 25-Day Plurality Index used to be interpreted as bullish for the stock market when it rose above the 12,000 level and bearish when it fell below 6,000.

It combines one shorter (fast) and one longer (slow) moving average to generate buy and sell signals when the fast moving average crosses above the slow moving average. Sell when the fast mov- average crosses below the slow moving average. The period lengths of each mov- ing average could be allowed to vary in any way; producing a number of possibilities One possible MetaStock System Test could be expressed as follows: Enter Mov(CLOSE,optl,E) > Mov(CLOSE,optl*opt2,E) Close Mov(CLOSE,optl,E) Mov(CLOSE,optl*opt2,E) Enter short: Mov(CLOSE,optl,E) Mov(CLOSE,optl*opt2,E) Close short: Mov(CLOSE,optl,E) > Mov(CLOSE,opt]*opt2,E) Turtle Soup Master trader Richard Dennis trained group of raw recruits he named Turtles. One of their strategies reportedly was to trade in the direction of a breakout from a Price Channel, specifically, when price makes a new 20-day high and sell short when price makes a new 20-day low The recipe for Turtle Soup is to fade the Turtles when price reverses immediately after such a breakout and, hopefully, collect fast profits when the trend followers cut losses. (See Place a protective stop just beyond the entry bar extreme, and trail the stop if price moves in the right direction. (See Connors, Laurence A,, and Raschke, Linda Bradford, Street Smarts, High Probability Short-- Trading Strategies, M Gordon Publishing Group, Malibu, California, 1995, 239 pages.) Typical Price The Typical Price is calculated by adding the high; low, and closing prices together; and then dividing by three. The result is thought to be a rough estimate of the average or typical for the period. The Typical Price may be used with many indicators in the place of the closing But in our testing, the closing price produces better results_ Buy ing long: long: buy Trap: ) Term price price. Ultimate Oscillators 715 Ultimate Oscillator The Ultimate Oscillator is a time-weighted price momentum oscillator introduced by Larry Williams, "The Ultimate Oscillator" Technical Analysis of Stocks Com- modities magazine, V 3.4, (WWW.traders.com). The Ultimate Oscillator uses time- weighted sums of three different oscillators, each of which is a sum of price change ratios over three different time periods, the First Cycle (short-term) , the Second Cy- cle (intermediate-term) and the Third Cycle (long-term). First, calculate buying pres- sure each defined as the current closing price minus the lower of the current low Or the previous s low. Sum this buying pressure over three separate time ods: First Cycle, Williams suggests 7 days; Second Cycle, twice the first cycle or 14 and the Third Cycle twice the second cycle or 28 days. (Of course, any other time intervals, measured in minutes, weeks or months, could be adapted to the basic concept:, Next, these buying pressure sums are divided by similar sums True Range. (These ratios may be thought of as the sums of buying pressure divided by the sums of buying pressure plus selling pressure ) Finally, those three ratios ing pressureltotal pressure over three different time frames) are weighted by 4 for the First Cycle, 2 for the Second Cycle and 1 for the Third Cycle. Once calculated, the Ultimate Oscillator may be interpreted in six steps each for and shorts, according to Williams. For positions: 1. The oscillator must have established an oversold reading below 30. 2. There must be bullish divergence setup, where the security' $ makes a lower low that is not confirmed by a lower low in the oscillator: 3_ The oscillator must break its downtrend line. 4_ When the oscillator establishes a pattern of higher highs from an oversold extreme low below 30, there is confirmation of a new oscillator up- trend, new positive momentum, and a bullish change in the probable trend of the security' $ 5. Take long-side profits when the oscillator moves to an extremely over- bought level above 70. 6. Close longs when the oscillator rises above 50 then falls below 45. For short positions: 1. The oscillator must have established at least a mildly overbought reading above 50. 2. There must be a bearish divergence setup, where the security'$ price makes higher high that is not confirmed by higher high in the oscillator: 3. The oscillator must break its uptrend line. day; period' peri- days; days; using (buy- longs long price point price. 716 Technical Market Indicators 4 When the oscillator establishes a pattern of lows from an over- bought extreme high point; there is confirmation of new oscillator downtrend, new negative momentum, and a bearish change in the proba- ble trend of the security' $ price. 5. Take short side profits when the oscillator moves to an extremely oversold level below 30. 6. Close shorts when the oscillator rises above 65. Indicator Strategy Example for the Ultimate Oscillator There are alternate ways to interpret the Ultimate Oscillator: (See Oscillators:_ If we allow each of Williams' parameters to vary, there would be a staggering num- ber of possibilities. One way to start might be to test the overboughtloversold para- meters against observed data. Based on a 18-year file of daily data for the entire history of the S&P 500 Com- posite Stock Price Index futures CSI Perpetual Contract (Www.csidata.com) from 4/21/82 to 12/29/00, we found that the following parameters would have produced a positive result on a purely mechanical signal basis with no subjectivity, no sophisti- cated technical analysis, and no judgement: Enter Long (Buy) at the current daily price close of the S&P 500 Com- Stock Price Index futures CSI Perpetual Contract when the Ulti- mate Oscillator is below 43. Close Long (Sell) at the current daily close of the S&P 500 Com- Stock Price Index futures CSI Perpetual Contract when the Ulti- mate Oscillator is above 73.

Most commonly, daily or weekly NYSE data is used in the calculation, and similar indicators could be applied to data from other exchanges. The assumption behind the indicator is that stock prices tend to bottom out when the great majority of stocks are participating in a market decline. Therefore, the Unchanged Issues Index is Conversely, the popular interpretation is that the market tops out when the majority of stocks stall out due to full valuation, and the Unchanged Issues Index is high: The popular interpretation does not hold up under objective testing, however: On the contrary, the data suggests that relatively high readings on the Unchanged Is- sues Index are bearish, while low readings are bullish: But the results are not strong: Indicator Strategy Example of the Unchanged Issues Index Based on a 68-year file of daily data for the Unchanged Issues Index (the total num- ber of shares unchanged divided by the total number of shares traded each day on the NYSE) and the DJIA since 1932, we found that extreme moves below and above Bollinger Bands placed at two standard deviations around the previous day'$ 7-day exponential moving average (See Bollinger Bands) would have produced a mildly positive result on a purely mechanical signal basis with no subjectivity, no sophisti- cated technical analysis, and no judgement: Enter (Buy) at the current daily price close of the DJIA when the Unchanged Issues Index falls below the previous day'$ lower Bollinger Band placed at two standard deviations below a 7-day exponential moving average (EMA) of the Unchanged Issues Index.

The resulting difference is then divided by the Total net profit: The Buy/Hold Indexis the Total net profit minus the buy-and-hold strategy's net profit: 8 resulting difference is then divided by the buy-and-hold net profit: In this exercise, initial equity is assumed to be $100_ Both long and short positions are taken unless otherwise noted: Trades are executed at the closing price on the signal date.

High readings indicate buying pressure, which is bullish: Low readings reflect selling pressure, which is bearish: Martin Zweig (900 Third Avenue, New York, NY 10022, (212) 755-9860) found that a daily Upside/Downside Ratio of greater than 9 to 1 has been extremely bullish: Every bull market, and many strong intermediate up moves, have begun with greater than 9 to 1 reading of the Upside/Downside Ratio. Furthermore, in cases where two readings greater than 9 to 1 occurred within 3 months or less, average in stock were significant: From January 1960 to 1985, 12 signals were given, by 2 days within a 3-month period having readings of greater than 9 to 1. In every case Zweig found that stock were higher 6 and 12 months later: The average after 6 and 12 months were 14 and 20.79, respectively: Updating Zweig' s study since 1985, there have been only four signals where two readings greater than 9 to 1 occurred within 3 months On balance, the four signals that did occur were profitable, as measured from the second 9 to 1 signal date. The results are shown in the table below. There have not been two signals within 3 months since September 6, 1988.

Plain volatility without trend di- rection is generally misleading: There are many ways to compute volatility. Many use Greek symbols and are quite complex and difficult to understand. All methods attempt to quantify how much fluctuation there has been. Volatility is often defined as a measure of a stock's tendency to move up and down in price, based on its daily history over; say, the latest month or year or other period. As an example of perhaps the simplest possible approach to a difficult problem, volatility might be defined as the percentage change or fluctuation over a given of time. (Note that you would need to use percentage changes rather than dollar o changes to allow proper comparisons over time because of dramatically changing levels in the bull market: We have experimented with many formulations of volatility and found that volatility is a coincident indicator that can change frequently, rapidly and unpre- dictably, or hardly at all, depending on the mood of the trading crowd. Price fluctua- tion alone, without consideration for price trend, appears to contain little useful information. And this is the weakness of strategies that depend on historical volatil- ity, such as many past options and derivatives valuation attempts The use of complex measures of variance based on past volatility to construct portfolios and to value derivatives does not appear to have allowed users to outper- form the benchmark S&P 500 Index buy-and-hold strategy: On the contrary, the com plex mathematics of finance failed spectacularly at least twice in the past: Portfolio Insurance caused, or at least worsened, the Crash of 1987; and in August 1998 Long- Term Capital Management's failed derivatives strategies brought the entire U.S. fi- nancial system to the brink of disaster; which was only narrowly averted by timely intervention by Federal Reserve Board officials. Mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot conjectured that stock price change distribu- tions have infinite variance. Bill Eckhardt (Schwager; Jack D. The New Market Wiz- ards, Harper Collins, New York; 1992, 493 pages) pointed out that if this variance is not finite, then sometime in the unforeseeable future there could be more extreme sce- narios than we might be able to imagine. Even the 1-day, 20% S&P 500 Index drop on October 19, 1987, might not be as extreme as it possibly could become. Also, if market prices do not have a finite variance, then any classically derived estimate of risk for the buy-and-hold strategy could be significantly understated. In sum, historical measures of volatility, without consideration for trend direc- tion, cannot be counted on. Volatility measurements taken over the past 30-days O a price price price period price point price price long price Volatility, CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) 729 year; however popular; may prove badly misleading at the most critical times when we need good analysis the most: Volatility; Chaikin's Chaikin' s Volatility, developed by veteran technical analyst Marc Chaikin, measures the smoothed velocity of the spread between a security' $ high and low prices. First, Chaikin subtracts the daily low from the high: Next; he calculates a 10-day exponen- tial moving average of those daily differences. Finally, he computes a 10-day per- centage rate-of-change of that exponential moving average _ 62-years of daily high-low data from 1928, we found that a marginal would have been made if we bought the DJIA when Chaikin' s Volatility crossed below zero, indicating falling volatility, and we sold and sold short when it crossed above zero, indicating rising volatility This strategy would have lost money since the Crash of 87, solely due to persistent losses on the short side in the record breaking bull market: A long-only strategy would have been profitable, but even that under performed buy-and-hold. The opposite strategy, buying rising volatility and selling falling volatility, would have lost heavily. Like other volatility indicators we have tested, Chaikin's Volatility does not appear particularly fruitful as a stand-alone indicator: The MetaStock indicator-builder formula for Chaikin's Volatility may be ex- pressed as follows: ROC(Mov(H-L,lO,E),10,%); Input("Plot a horizontal line at" ,-100,100,0); Volatility, CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) The CBOEs Volatility Index (VIX) is a relatively new volatility indicator that has gained popularity with some traders because it offers up-to-the-minute estimates of the stock market's implied volatility real-time stock option bidlask quotes. VIX is weighted average of the implied volatilities of eight OEX calls and puts with an average time to maturity of 30 Implied volatility is the volatility percentage that explains the current market of an Implied volatility reflects option spec- ulators emotions of greed and fear: VIX shoots upward when options traders fear the market might collapse.

Indicator Strategy Example for Volatility (VIX) Historical data shows that Volatility (VIX) is bullish when in a trend. On the long side, the trend of VIX would have been profitable, though not as profitable as the buy-and-hold strategy, and right more often than wrong On the short side, however_ the trend of VIX would have been unprofitable across all daily time horizons and wrong more often than right: Based on the VIX as posted on the CBOE web site and a 14.75-year file of daily data for the S&P 500 Composite Stock Price Index futures CSI Perpetual Contract from January 1986 to September 2000 collected from WWw.csidata com, we found that the following parameters would have produced the following result o a purely mechanical trend-following signal basis with no subjectivity, no sophisticated techni- cal analysis, and no judgement: Enter Long (Buy) at the current daily close of the S&P 500 Com- posite Stock Price Index futures CSI Perpetual Contract when VIX today is greater than yesterday's 10-day EMA of VIX, indicting a rising trend of Volatility: Close Long (Sell) at the current daily close of the S&P 500 Com- Stock Price Index futures CSI Perpetual Contract when VIX today is less than yesterday's 10-day EMA of VIX, indicting a falling trend of Volatility.

Here, when the price both breaks out of a trading range and price volatil- ity increases on the breakout, a signal to or sell is recognized. Volatility can be described various ways, including Average True Range, which is an average of recent high minus low price ranges over some variable look-back period, such as 6 An increase in volatility indicates greater price movement, which implies greater inten - sity of buying O selling: This greater movement and intensity make the action more significant than a breakout alone without increasing volatility Therefore, price channel breakout with rising volatility triggers a signal to or sell in order to follow the direction of the breakout.

Outliers are unusual, aberrant data points that stray far from the mean. Outliers can offer trading opportunities. Several known trading systems at- tempt to take advantage of data outliers. Statistics are commonly used to measure the variability of data around its cen- tral tendency, quantifying how far from the mean the observations stray and how much variability is normal and abnormal. Variability (the spread of the data) can be measured by the range, variance, and standard deviation. Range is simply the high minus the low in the data sample and it includes all outliers, which might give one a distorted impression of the typical variability. Variance measures the average variability around the mean by summing the squared deviations of each data from the mean, then dividing that sum by the number of observations minus one, as expressed in the following formula: ((x _ #)2)) s2 = (SUMMATION ((x Mean)?)) / (n 1) n _ 1 Standard Deviation is the square root of the Variance. This may appear to be more useful than Variance because, by taking the square root of the average squared differences between observed data points and their mean, we thereby convert the measure of variability back into the same units of measure as the raw data we started with. In the case of stocks, for example, the unit of measure would be dollars per share. The smaller the standard deviation; the more tightly the measurements in a sam- ple cluster around the mean. A smaller standard deviation implies greater consistency: A normal distribution, which is shaped like symmetrical bell curve, contains approximately 67% of all the observed data within plus o minus one standard devia- tion around the mean. Approximately 959 of the data is within plus o minus standard deviations around the mean. And approximately 99.7% of the data is within plus o minus three standard deviations around the mean Unfortunately, market data is not necessarily normally distributed. Rather; the distribution curve is often skewed to one side because of overbalance of data outliers in one direction. For example, in a sharply rising bull market, the distribution curve might be positively skewed, with a tail to the right: In a prolonged and severe bear market, however; there might be a negative skew, with a long tail to the left: The problem is that any statistics we may calculate are entirely dependent on past data rather than reflecting the unknown future data that we can only wish we had. That deficiency may not entirely preclude detection of some useful tendencies, other point two long Volatility Ratios 739 things equal. Still, experience in sudden market jolts, such as the Crash of Oc- tober 1987, suggests that reliance on past tendencies may be costly when investor emotions are running wild. Mechanical and statistical tools need to be filtered with sound technical analysis. For a further discussion of the statistical approach to volatility expansions, see: Kase, Cynthia A,, Trading with the Odds: Using the Power of Probability to Profit in the Futures Market, Irwin Professional Publishing, 1996, 149 pages. Volatility Index, Art Merrill's Version Arthur A Merrill, CMT; has devised a simple measure of volatility for the DJIA by simply calculating the absolute value of the daily percentage changes. He aver- ages these daily changes for each full week (which is usually five trading except when there is holiday). Then he smoothes this average weekly volatility with 5-week EMA: Merrill   calculates   plus and minus 67% of one standard   deviation of the smoothed volatility: These should contain the middle quartiles, approximately He in- terprets the S-week exponentially smoothed volatility relative to its upper and 67% of one standard deviation bands as follows: a ratio above 67% of one standard deviation is bullish; a ratio below 67% of one standard deviation is bearish: Using a chi-squared test of significance and a test period covering 1971 to 1982, Merrill found that this indicator correctly predicted the direction of the general mar- ket as measured by the DJIA 63% of the time over the next 13 weeks This result was highly significant statistically. It predicted the market 60% of the time over the next 26 weeks, which was significant It accurately predicted 57% of the time over the next 5 weeks, which was probably significant: Accuracy over the next one and 52 weeks was only a little better than 50%, which was insignificant statistically: Volatility Ratios Pure volatility measures that fail to distinguish upside price movement from down- side price movement are of questionable value market timing: In the first edition of this encyclopedia, we tested weekly High/Low price ratios applied to the New York Stock Composite Index as a simple measure of volatility We were not able to find any objective decision rule that offered consistent profitability. The distribution of profits over various time lengths assumed erratic patterns. There were losses in many time intervals. We concluded that volatility as a market timing indicator did not appear to be fruitful. being price days; lower for using 740 Technical Market Indicators For this second edition, we tested the absolute value of daily closing per- centage changes for the DJIA from 1900 to 2001 using our standard Exponential Moving Average Crossover model. Again, we were not able to find a timing rule that beat buy-and-hold.

Results were discouraging for all approaches long: long: price Volume 743 Volume Volume is a key technical indicator serving an important analytical function: The vol- ume of stock transactions, also known as turnover and trading activity is the number of shares changing hands in given period (hour; week, month, year; and So forth) . High and rising volume confirms the price trend in a bull market Volume usu- ally peaks before the final price top. Also, volume confirms breakouts: when price moves out of a sideways trading range, through a sloping Trend Channel, or through any support Or resistance level, volume should increase to confirm the validity of the breakout. When a stock breaks out upward, pickup in volume indicates fresh buying in- terest, new demand, new buyers entering the market When a stock breaks out downward; pickup in volume indicates fresh selling; new supply, new sellers entering the market: A breakout lacking volume confirmation is not to be entirely trusted Low vol- ume indicates apathy, indecision, and lack of attraction to a stock on both sides, the side and the sell side. Then, is more likely to drift aimlessly reflecting lack of investor interest in the stock. A breakout on low volume is more likely to be an aberration. Occasionally, high volume can also signal a temporary excess, an overbought o oversold extreme. Extremely active trading is sometimes associated with minor price turning points, as in a buying or selling climax, when the irrational exuberance of the crowd reaches an unsustainable extreme These junctures can be followed by price temporary corrections in the opposite direction to the prevailing trend. Generally however; a major trend is not reversed by just one high-volume climax. Rather; it takes time and further testing to turn the Primary Tide. A great old Wall Street saying is, Volume is a weapon of the Bullit-takes fresh buying to higher; but can fall of their own weight True, it does take relatively strong demand from buyers versus supply from sellers to push higher: Prices move up when demand (buying) overbalances supply (supply). Also, in general, high volume is bullish more often than not: Since for every share that is sold a share is bought, high volume at least indicates that significant buying de- mand is present: On the other hand, can fall a distance on light volume. For example, well into a bear market; after investors realize that stock are in persistent down- trend, few want to stocks, so volume dries up. Prices can drift a way down as sellers look for bids but do not find enough bids to absorb all their stock offerings. So, volume can remain relatively low while prices move lower and as sellers search for buyers willing to take the stock, to take the other side of the trade. When day; buy price push prices prices prices prices long prices buy long lower 744 Technical Market Indicators there are no bids nearby, the price may fall in a vacuum, dropping straight down with no volume at all, making a price gap on the chart There is no perfect indicator; and volume is subject to distortions that can boost or depress the total number of shares changing hands for reasons other than demand and supply: These distortions include holidays, seasonal patterns, and sell pro- grams, arbitrage, dynamic hedging, block trades, and index fund position adjust- ments. When these distortions become significant, indicators weighted by volume suffer some instability: Another great old Wall Street saying is, In there is knowledge. True, most reliably and consistently reflects the demand and supply balance for stocks. Nevertheless, volume is a very useful confirming indicator that has proved it- self over many decades of actual practice. Volume adds value to a complete technical analysis: Indicator Strategy Example for Pure Volume Only There are many indicators that incorporate volume, and are covered in these pages. The best volume indicators combine volume with price. At the purest and most basic level, historical data shows that high volume is bullish and low volume is bear- ish. Based on the trend of the number of shares traded each on the NYSE for 72 years from 1928 to 2000, we found that the following parameters would have pro- duced a positive result on purely mechanical trend-following signal basis with no subjectivity, no sophisticated technical analysis, and no judgement: Enter Long (Buy) at the current daily close of the DJIA when the NYSE Volume is greater than yesterday's 220-day EMA of the daily volume_ Close Long (Sell) at the current daily close of the DJIA when the NYSE Volume today is less than yesterday's 220-day EMA of the daily volume_ Enter Short (Sell Short) at the current daily price close of the DJIA when the NYSE Volume today is less than yesterday's 220-day EMA of the daily volume.

This   would have been 177.21% better than the passive buy-and-hold strategy. There would have been more winning trades than losing trades for long trades, but the opposite would have been true for short sales. Curiously, the Volume trend-following strategy would not have been profitable over the past 14 years, due to losses on short sales.

In their sim- plest forms, are based on the running total of each day's volume times the dif- ference between the daily closing price minus the midpoint of the daily range. So, instead of measuring change from the previous close, which is the more common practice, here we measure the day'$ price change from the day'$ median price, the mid point: Mathematically, the formula for the cumulative total of Volume Accumulation is expressed as follows: Cum((C-(H+L)2)*V) where Cum means cumulating a running total of the daily values of the expression that follows in parenthesis. C = the closing for a period. H = the highest price for the same period. L the lowest price for the period. the total volume of trading activity for the period. For example, if the current period's highest price is 180, the lowest price 160, the close 165, and the volume 2000, then the day'$ closing price of 165 minus the midpoint of 170 is minus 5. Then, multiply -5 times the volume of 2000 to ar- rive at the day's Volume Accumulation of 10,000: (C-(H+L))*V = ((165-(180+1609/2)*2000 = (-5)*2000 10,000 Next, compute a running total of these daily calculations for the Volume Accumula- tion Cumulative Total. We can then plot that as line, and we can measure the trend of that cumulative total of daily values in various ways, including chart patterns, trend lines, moving averages, etc. For example, the chart at the top of the facing page shows the Volume Accumulation Cumulative Total with a large rollover top (like a Complex Head-and-Shoulders Top) in 1999 and in 2000 , offering dramatic bilities in chart interpretation. Note that with Volume Accumulation so negative, its followers might have been unprofitably bearish from October 1999 until the joint S&P and NASDAQ top in March 2000. Alternately, we can convert this cumulative total into an oscillator by, for exam- ple, subtracting from it some moving average of itself: (See Oscillators:, The chart at the bottom of the page shows Volume Accumulation as a sensitive, short-term oscillator, computed by subtracting the current Volume Accumulation cumulative total minus its own previous day's 2-day EMA, then dividing that difference by the they price price price day" sharp drop possi- facing Volume Accumulation Oscillator; Volume Accumulation Trend 753 Cf Cum Accum Trend (12,763,939} 30000 25001 Volume Accumulation CumulativeTotal zo02d) 15020 10CX01 50001 YOOD 130007 12000 IT000 I0OOD 9000 8000 7000 Dow-Jones Industrial Average 600} 5000 4008 10O0D 5000 1994 1995 935 41597 1398 1989 2000 Volume Accumulation as a sensitive; 0.25 short-term oscillator 0.15E 0.10 0,051 ~,00] ~.05- 8.10 0.15 0.20 0.25 11700 11600 11600 11400 11300 1200 1100 11000 10900 10800 10700 10800 10600 10400 10300 10200 10100 Dow-Jones Industrial Average in Year 2000 9800: 9700 9600 9500 1O000 L March May une Buw 10002 Ap: 754 Technical Market Indicators previous day's 2-day EMA, in order to normalize the scale.

Compute daily net advancing volume by subtracting the Volume of Declin- Issues from the Volume of Advancing Issues traded each on the NYSE. 2_ Add that daily net difference to the cumulative total of the daily net advanc- volume as of the preceding day: Historically, the interpretation of this indicator has been dependent on the chart reading skills of the technical analyst; who typically relies upon his judgements of trend, pattern, and divergence versus stock index, such as the S&P 500 or the DJIA Indicator Strategy Example for the Cumulative Volume Index The Cumulative Volume Index can be an effective indicator viewed entirely objec- tively. Based on 37-year file of daily data of the volume behind the number of shares advancing and declining each day o the NYSE and the DJIA, we found that the simplest possible trend-following rule would have produced a positive result on a purely mechanical signal basis with no subjectivity, no sophisticated technical analy- sis, and no judgement: Enter Long (Buy) at the current daily close of the DJIA when the Cumulative Volume Index rises relative to its level the previous Close Long (Sell) at the current daily close of the DJIA when the Cumulative Volume Index falls relative to its level the previous Enter Short (Sell Short) at the current daily close of the DJIA when the Cumulative Volume Index falls relative to its level the previous Close Short (Cover) at the current daily close of the DJIA when the Cumulative Volume Index rises relative to its level the previous Starting with S1O0 and reinvesting profits, total net profits for this Cumulative Volume Index trend-following strategy would have been $852,743.19, assuming a fully invested strategy, reinvestment of profits, no transactions costs, and no taxes. This would have been 66,357.029 better than buy-and-hold. Short selling would have been profitable, but not since the bottom of 8/12/82.

This is because it does not adjust for distortions that tend to inflate volume over time, namely, the ever growing number of issues listed, numerous stock splits, and derivatives arbitrage trading: To adjust the data in order to comparability; we could try the following transformation of the daily data before cumulating net volume in running total: V = (A-D)/(A + D) where V = today'$ 1-day Volume Index A = Volume of Advancing Issues D Volume of Declining Issues Curiously, this formula produces a chart line with a downward bias that is more mis- leading than the upward bias of the more popular Cumulative Volume Index. The rea- son behind these biases is that stocks tend to rise on high volume and fall on low volume_ As the old saying goes, "It takes volume to push stocks higher; but they fall of their own weight: Volume of Issues, Advancing The volume of advancing issues is the total volume of advancing stocks, those stocks that end the current at a higher than their previous day' $ closing Data for the New York Stock Exchange is used most frequently, and data for the NASDAQ and American Stock Exchange is also widely available.

Coupled with Advancing volume, Declining volume is most often used as a component of another indicator: Volume: Klinger Oscillator (KO) This volume-based oscillator was developed by Stephen J. Klinger: It is computed in seven steps: 1. Find the average price of the day by summing the high; low, and close, then dividing by three. 2_ If today'$ average is greater than the previous day'$ average price, as- sign a plus sign to today'$ volume. 3_ If today'$ average is less than the previous day'$ average price, assign minus sign to today'$ volume. 4 Calculate a 34-period exponential moving average of the signed vol- ume from Steps 2 and 3 5. Calculate 55-period exponential moving average of the signed volume from Steps 2 and 3. 6_ Subtract the 34-period exponential moving average from the 55-period ex- ponential moving average, and plot this difference. 7. Calculate and plot a 13-period exponential moving average of the daily dif- ferences from 6. When today'$ average price is greater than yesterday' $ average price, that is de- fined as accumulation_ Conversely, when today's average price is less than yester- day'$ average price, that is defined as distribution. When the sums are equal, the forces of demand and supply are considered to be in balance. The average difference between the number of shares being accumulated and distributed each day is defined as the volume force. A trend of volume force is bullish; while a falling trend of price price. price price period Step rising Volume: Klinger Oscillator (KO) 763 volume force is bearish: The Klinger Oscillator also is compared to to identify divergences Indicator Strategy Example for Klinger Oscillator Based on 18-year file of daily data for the entire history of the S&P 500 Composite Stock Price Index Futures CSI Perpetual Contract from 4/21/82 to 12/29/00 collected from www.csidata.com; we found that the following parameters would have produced below-average results on purely mechanical overboughtloversold signal basis with no subjectivity, no sophisticated technical analysis, and no judgement: Enter Long (Buy) at the current daily close of the S&P 500 Com- Stock Price Index futures CSI Perpetual Contract when the current Oscillator (using the standard parameters, above) crosses above its own trailing 2-day EMA computed as of the previous day'$ close: Close (Sell) at the current daily price close of the S&P 500 Com- posite Stock Price Index futures CSI Perpetual Contract when the current Klinger Oscillator (using the standard parameters, above) crosses below its own trailing 2-day EMA computed as of the previous day'$ close: Enter Short (Sell Short) never: Starting with $100 and reinvesting profits, total net profits would have been S261.46, assuming a fully invested strategy, reinvestment of profits, no transactions costs, and no taxes.

Of course, there are exceptions to these generalities, but hold more often than not: Ned Davis Research found that modestly above-average returns would have been gained for long trades only if we buy when the smoothed NYSEIOTC Volume Ratio rises above 102.129, indicating a cautious, "quality" investment psychology; and then sell our long position when the NYSEIOTC Volume Ratio falls below 96.359, indicating an excessively speculative" mass mood. Volume: On-Balance Volume (OBV) On-Balance Volume (OBV) is a price and volume trend quantification popularized by Joseph E. Granville, author ofA New Strategy of Daily Stock Market Timing for Max- imum Profit; Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ, 1976. It is easy to calculate: if the price close today is above the close yesterday, then the entire day's volume is as- signed a plus sign; but if the price close today is below the close yesterday, then the entire day's volume is assigned a minus sign. Note that it does not matter how much the price changes today, a penny O ten dollars Only the direction of the price up or down, determines the plus o minus sign assigned to the entire day'$ volume. Each day's OBV is cumulated in a running total that can be compared visually to the graph of the pure trend for confirmation Or divergence. Mathematically, today'$ OBV input before cumulating can be computed as follows: OBV = (C-P) / | C-PI) V where C = the current period s closing P = the previous period'$ closing IC-Pl = the absolute value of the difference between the two closing prices. V = the current period'< s volume. they they change, price price. price.

Buy 768 Technical Market Indicators Since any positive number divided by the absolute value of itself is one, the ex- pression in parentheses serves only to determine the sign, plus Or minus. Thus, if the current period'$ price change is positive (rising), with C greater than P; volume is as- signed a plus sign for the period. But if C is less than P; the has fallen and vol- ume is assigned a minus sign for that period. The cumulative running total of daily OBV respects the daily OBV plus O mi- nus sign. This results in a cumulative OBV line that rises every that rises and that falls every that falls. The day's volume determines the amount of this rise or fall. There are a variety of ways to analyze OBV all the technical tools of trend assessment, overboughtloversold oscillators, and divergence analysis. By far the sim- plest way is to use a computer to find an objective trend-following decision rule  The Equis International MetaStock Indicator Builder formula for plotting Cu- mulative OBV is written as follows: (If(C>Ref(C,-1),1,-1)*V)+PREV Indicator Strategy Example for On-Balance Volume Historical data shows that OBV is one of the better volume-based indicators. It beat buy-and-hold strategy by an extremely margin. Still, it is a slightly less effective indicator than the Volume Price Momentum Oscillator (V*PMO), particularly on the short side. Based on the number of shares traded each day on the NYSE and the daily for the DJIA for 72 years from 1928 to 2001, we found that the following pa- rameters would have   produced positive result on purely  mechanical trend- following signal basis with no subjectivity, no sophisticated technical analysis, and no judgement: Enter Long (Buy) at the current daily close of the DJIA when the cumulative OBV line crosses above its previous day's 3-day EMA. Close Long (Sell) at the current daily close of the DJIA when the cu- mulative OBV line crosses below its previous day's 3-day EMA Enter Short (Sell Short) at the current daily price close of the DJIA when the cumulative OBV line crosses below its previous day's 3-day EMA.

For example, we found that 220-day EMA of Volume can be used to define active Or inactive trading activity: By calculating the percentage deviation of volume from its 220-day trend, and graph- it; we can visually grasp exactly how much trading activity is above Or below normal. For example, can readily comprehend with a glance at the following chart when stock turnover is, say, 50% above or below normal. Simply subtract from cur- rent volume its own trailing 220-day EMA, divide that difference by the 220-day EMA, then multiply that ratio by 100 in order to convert the ratio fraction to a per- centage, as shown in the following Equis MetaStock Indicator Builder formula: V-(Ref(Mov( V,220,E),-1))) K(Ref(Mov(V,220,E),-1))*100; Input("Plot a horizontal line at" ,-0.25,0.25,0); where V the total volume of trading activity for the period.

P today'$ price change, close minus the previous day'$ close. For example, if today' $ price change is a decline of 4 points and today'$ volume is 200, then today's V*PMO input value is 800. Next, compute an exponential moving average of these daily changes mul- tiplied by volume. This smoothes the erratic daily data enough to allow us to plot a momentum oscillator useful for system development and, possibly, useful for subjec- tive interpretation, including divergence analysis. As with simple momentum indicators generally; when the exponential moving average of V*PMO is positive, momentum is bullish, so we entering O initiating position. But when the exponential moving average of V*PMO is negative, close out positions and enter short position. Indicator Strategy Example for the Volume * Price Momentum Oscillator (V*PMO) Historical data shows that the Volume * Price Momentum Oscillator (V*PMO) would have been an effective indicator; particularly on the side. Based on the number of shares traded each day on the NYSE and the daily for the DJIA for 72 years from 1928 to 2001, we found that the following parameters would have produced a significantly positive result on purely mechanical trend-following signal basis with no subjectivity, no sophisticated technical analysis, and no judgement: Enter Long (Buy) at the current daily close of the DJIA when the 3-day EMA of the daily V*PMO is greater than zero. Close Long (Sell) at the current daily close of the DJIA when the EMA of the daily V*PMO is less than zero_ Enter Short (Sell Short) at the current daily close of the DJIA when the 3-day EMA of the daily V*PMO is less than zero.

Volume Reversal was developed by Mark A. Leibovit; a technical analyst who has specialized in transactional activity studies. Leibovit is ed- itor of The Volume Reversal Survey (PO Box 1451, Sedona, AZ 86339), semi- monthly  market newsletter: Volume Reversal is based on the ancient technical analysis observation that volume should increase to confirm a change in directional price movement Leibovit's Volume Reversal interpretation depends entirely on the following definitions: An increase in volume occurs when today's total transactional activity is greater than the previous day'$ volume of trade. A Rally occurs when the current intraday high is higher than the previ- ous day's high and the current intraday low is the same or higher than the previous day's low. A Reaction occurs when the current intraday low is lower than the pre- vious day's low and the current intraday high is the same o lower than the previous day's high: A Positive Volume Reversal occurs when a change from a Reaction to a Rally Day is accompanied by an increase in volume. It is time to A Negative Volume Reversal occurs when a change from a Rally Day to a Reaction Day is accompanied by an increase in volume. It is time to sell. Significantly, we should highlight what is specifically ignored as not relevant in Leibovit's Volume Reversal interpretation: An Inside occurs when the current intraday high is the same O than the previous day's high, and when the current intraday low is the same or higher than the previous day's low An Outside Day occurs when the current intraday high is higher than the previous day'$ high, and when the current intraday low is lower than the previous day's low. The Close is the last of the and it to counts for nothing: close examination of the and sell arrows on the chart on the facing page should make these definitions clear: In our independent Indicator Strategy testing, this indicator underperformed a passive buy-and-hold strategy in recent years. As the chart of the S&P Depositary Re- cipts shows, a cumulative Volume Reversal indicator peaked out  July 22, 1997, which was too early for practical trading purposes. It appears that Leibovit'$ success depends on his judgement based on his experience, rather than on any sim- ple, mechanical interpretation of this indicator: Day Day Day buy: lower Day price day; buy good_ long +1050 11000 Sell VOLUME REVERSAL SIGNALS FOR THE DJIA 10950 109001 10850 Sell 10800 10750 10700 10650 10600 Sell 10550 10500 10450 10400 10350 10300 10250 10200 10150 DAILY VOLUME 10100 10000 X1OC JQ_ June July 8 Buy Buy Buy Buy 780 Technical Market Indicators The Equis International MetaStock" Indicator Builder Dialog for a cumulative Volume Reversal indicator (similar to On Balance Volume may be written as follows: Cum ((If(H>Ref(H,-1)) AND (L>=Ref(L,-1)) AND (V>Ref(V-1)),V,O)) +(If((H<=Ref(H,-1)) AND (L<Ref(L,-1)) AND (V>Ref(V-I))-V,O))) The Equis International MetaStock System Testing rules may be written as follows: Enter H>Ref(H,-1) AND L>=Ref(L,-1) AND V>Ref(V-l) Close H<-Ref(H,-1) AND L<Ref(L;-1) AND V>Ref(V-1) Enter short: H<-Ref(H,-1) AND L<Ref(L;-1) AND VRef(V-l) Close short: HzRef(H,-1) AND L>=Ref(L,-1) AND V>Ref(V-l) 5000 5000 55000 5000 10000 10000 15000 -15000 20000- Volume: WVAD (upper line) 2000C' S&P Depositary Receipts (middle line) 25000 Volume Histogram (lower line) -25000 30000 30000 35000 -35000 A0000 40000 %icd] K1n 150- 150 145 145_ 140 140 135 135= 130 130 125 125 120 120 115 1151 110 110 105 105 100 100 100000 10OO0O 500o0 socoo} 11997 A MJ ] A $ 0 ND 1998 Amj ]AA 5 0 N D 1999" A MJ J A 5 D' Z000 Amj j As0 ND ZC01 A mJJA So N D 2002 A MJ ] long: long: 0 N Volume Up Days/Down Days 781 Volume Up Days/Down Days The Volume Up Days/Down Days, developed by award-winning technical analyst, Arthur A.

According to Art Merrill's research; readings above 1.05 are bullish, while readings below 0.95 are bearish: Day 782 Technical Market Indicators Volume: Williams' Variable Accumulation Distribution (WVAD) Williams' Variable Accumulation Distribution (WVAD) is a volume-weighted momentum indicator; developed by Larry Williams. WVAD is based on the idea that the best measure of a day'$ buying power and selling pressure is dependent on the Ie- lationship between the number of points that the market has moved from its opening to its closing price for the day: Specifically, it is calculated and interpreted in six steps: 1. Subtract the opening from the closing price. Respect the sign, plus or minus. 2_ Divide that difference (from 1) by the difference of the high minus the low: 3. Multiply that ratio (from 2) by the volume 4 Average that product (from Step 3) over a moving window ofn-days of time. 5. If the moving average (from Step 4) is positive, net buying pressure is dom- inant SO a long position is initiated. 6_ If the moving average (from 4) is negative, net selling pressure is dom- inant SO a short position is initiated. Mathematically, Steps 1 through 3 of the WVAD formula can be expressed as: WVAD = (((C-0) / (H _ L)) where C = the current S closing 0 = the current period' S opening H the current period' high L = the current period s low the current period S s volume. For example, if the current day'$ opening was 175, the high was 180, the low was 160,the close was 165, and the volume was 2000 shares, then: WVAD=( ((165-1759/(180-160)) 2000) 1000 In 4,for a 4-period WVAD , for example, this 1000 would become an in- put for a 4-day moving average. In our independent Indicator Strategy testing, this indicator underperformed a passive buy-and-hold strategy As the chart of the S&P Depositary Receipts shows, such a cumulative WVAD indicator peaked out on April 3, 1998, which was too early for practical trading purposes It appears that Williams success depends on his good judgement based on his experience, rather than on any simple, mechanical in- terpretation of this indicator: price price price Step Step Step *V ) period s price. price. price. price. price Step - long Volume: Williams' Variable Accumulation Distribution (WVAD) 783 The Equis International MetaStock Indicator Builder Dialog for a cummulative WVAD indicator may be written: Cum(((C-OJ(H-L))*V): The Equis International MetaStock System Testing rules may be written as follows: Enter Mov(((C-OJ(H-L))*V,optl,E) > 0 Close Mov(((C-OJ(H-L))*Voptl,E) < 0 Enter short: Mov(((C-OJ(H-L))*Voptl,E) < 0 Close short: Mov(((C-OJ(H-L))*Voptl,E) > 0 OPTI Current value: 4 5000 5000 5000 5000 10000 10000 15000 15000 20000: Volume: WVAD (upper line) 2000C' S&P Depositary Receipts (middle line) 25000 Volume Histogram (lower line) -25000 30000 30000 -35000 -35000 A0000 -40000 sic K1n 150- 150 145 145_ 140 140F 135 135= 130 130 125 125 120 120 115 1151 110 110 105 105 100 100 100000 10OO0O 500o0 socoo} Jul 1937 A MJ J A S 0 ND 1998 Am] ] AA 50 N D 1999" A MJ ; A 5 0 N D 2000 Am] J A 5.0 ND ZG01 AmJJA So N D 2002 A MJJA long: long: 784 Technical Market Indicators Wall Street Week (WSW) Technical Market Index The Wall Street Week (WSW) Technical Market Index was once one of the most widely followed technical market indicators, thanks to the popularity of the PBS weekly television program. It was a consensus index of ten different stock market in- dicators,  created by Robert J. Nurock; President/Market Strategist of Investor' $ Analysis, Inc-, PO. Box 460, Santa Fe, NM 87504-0460. Bob Nurock was the origi- nal "Chief Elf" one of the original regular panelists for many years after the show's inception in 1970. When Bob Nurock gave up show business, his Index left Wall Street Week with him. Still, Nurock's Wall Street Week (WSW) Technical Mar- ket Index is an interesting example of a complex, combination indicator with a highly significant record of performance. Introduced to the Wall Street Week audience on October 6, 1972, the WSW Technical Market Index was based on the weekly interpretations of ten different tech- nical market indicators. The Index ignored fundamental data on the economy, COI - porate earnings, and dividends. The ten technical market indicator readings were summed into one number designed to facilitate the perception of changes in investor psychology, market action, speculation, and monetary conditions that are often pres- ent at market turning points. The Index attempted to identify intermediate to long-term market moves (lasting 3-to-6 months, O longer), rather than short-term swings Nurock designed the Index to both confirm the continuation of a current trend (when the majority of its components are neutral) and also to provide early warning of a change in a prevailing trend (when five O more of its components to pos- itive or negative). How Nurock Constructed his Original Wall Street Week (WSW) Technical Market Index Nurock used the following ten Technical Market Indicators Nurock stated his inten- tion to update the specific formulas and interpretation levels annually. More current parameters are available separately under each indicator entry in this book: 1. Momentum Ratio measures the percentage difference between the DJIA and its 30-day simple moving average. Divide the DJIA's latest close by its most recent 30-day simple moving average. The resulting Momentum Os- cillator flashes overboughtloversold warnings when the DJIA deviates more than three percent (39) from its 30-day simple moving average. When the DJIA is more than three percent (39) below its 30-day simple moving av- erage, an extreme often registered at market bottoms, this indicator is tive and bullish: When the DJIA is more than three percent (39) above its 30-day simple moving average, an extreme often registered at market topS, this indicator is negative and bearish: and key swing- posi- Wall Street Week (WSW) Technical Market Index 785 2. Hi-Lo Index compares the total number of stocks attaining new highs ver- sus the number dropping to new lows over the past 10 trading on the NYSE. 10-day moving totals of both new highs and new lows are com- puted and compared. At significant market bottoms, few new highs are at- tained. At market tops, few new lows are registered. A reversal from either extreme confirms a change in market direction. When the number of new highs crosses above the number of new lows, it is positive and bullish: When the number of new highs crosses below the number of new lows, it is negative and bearish. 3_ Market Breadth Indicator is a moving total of the net difference between daily advances and declines over the 10 trading This breadth mo- mentum quantifies the underlying strength of market moves by indicating whether or not the majority of stocks are moving in the same direction as the market averages, an important confirmation of general market strength or weakness. It is positive and bullish when this indicator rises from below to above + 1000, and it remains positive until it declines 1000 points from its peak: It is negative and bearish when this indicator falls from above to below 1000, and it remains negative until it rises 1000 points from its trough. Readings between 1000 and + 1000 are neutral. 4_ Arms Short-Term Trading Index uses NYSE data to compute 10-day moving average of (Advances/Declines) (Advancing Volume/Declining Volume). Readings above 1.20 indicate extreme pessimism and are tive. Readings below .80 indicate extreme optimism and are negative: 5. Percentage of NYSE Stocks Above Their Moving Averages is oversold and therefore positive when less than 30% of NYSE stocks are trading above their own 10-week moving averages and less than 40% of NYSE stocks are trading above their own 30-week moving averages It is overbought and therefore negative when more than 70% of NYSE stocks are above their own 10-week averages and more than 60% are above their own 30-week moving averages_ 6_ Premium Ratio on Options divides the average premium on all listed put options by the average premium on all listed call options on a weekly basis. The raw data is from the Options Clearing Corporation (142 W. Jackson Blvd, Chicago, IL 60604). When the Premium Ratio is above 95.5%, it in- dicates investors are overly pessimistic, which is positive.

Advisory Service Sentiment survey by Investor'$ Intelligence categorizes the forecasts of about 100 stock market newsletters as bullish; bearish; or expecting market correction When sentiment becomes distinctly one- sided, a contrary move in the market is anticipated. When the percentage of bears plus half of the percentage expecting a correction rises above 51.59, it is positive and bullish: When the same calculation results in a reading be- low 35.59, it is negative and bearish. 8 Low-Priced Activity Ratio relates the level of trading volume in Barron '$ Low-Priced Stock Index to volume in the blue-chip DJIA: A ratio above 7.599 indicates high speculative activity, which is negative and bearish. A ratio below 2.829 indicates low speculation and is positive and bullish: 9. Insider Activity Ratio is a ratio of insider sell transactions relative to transactions, as compiled weekly by Vickers Stock Research Corporation: A ratio above 3.61 to 1 means that sellers are significantly more numerous than buyers, and that indicates that corporate insiders believe their stocks are overvalued and a downward price adjustment is likely. A ratio below 1.42 implies that insiders believe their stocks are undervalued and an upward price move is likely: Insiders are usually right 10. Fed Policy provides a to the direction of Federal Reserve Board pol- as reflected by the level of the Federal Funds Rate relative to the Dis- count Rate. The daily closing bid price for Fed Funds is divided by the Discount Rate. These ratios are smoothed by a 4-day average for Friday, Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday each week. Wednesday readings are omit- ted as are unusually volatile, due to end of the bank week transactions when individual banks even up reserve positions. The 4-day moving aver- age is negative above 1259, indicating a high Fed Funds Rate relative to the Discount Rate and tight money, which usually slows the growth of busi- ness and chokes the stock market. The moving average is positive be- low 103%, since low Fed Funds Rate relative to the Discount Rate indicates money, which fosters expansion of business and stock market: buy key guide icy; they 4-day rising easy Wall Street Week (WSW) Technical Market Index 787 How the Wall Street Week (WSW) Technical Market Index is Compiled The WSW Index is compiled once a week on Friday based on data available as of Thursday's close for each of the ten indicators. When an indicator reaches an extreme usually registered at mar ket bottoms, it is positive and bullish; and therefore it is assigned a value of plus one_ When an indicator reaches an extreme usually registered at mar ket tops, it is negative and bearish, and therefore it is assigned a value of minus one When an indicator is between extremes, it is neutral, and ther efore it is as- signed a value of zero The first time an indicator moves directly from one extreme to another (from positive to negative, or from negative to positive), it is assigned a neutral value of zero. That zero value is maintained until new plus o mi- nus value is reached. This first-time exception allows for a more gradual dissipation of the initial strong momentum typical of a new trend. Once this assignment of values (+1, 0, or 1) for each of the ten indicators is complete, the ten values are summed (respecting the sign, positive or negative) to ar- rive at the WSW Index reading for the week. For example, if four indicators are pOS- itive and bullish, five are neutral, and one is negative and bearish, the sum would be 4 + 0 - 1 =3. another example, if two indicators are bullish, one is neutral, seven are negative, the sum would be 2 + 0 _ 7 = 5. and For 788 Technical Market Indicators How the Wall Street Week (WSW) Technical Market Index is Interpreted WSW Current Reading Interpretation 10 Extremely Bullish 9 Extremely Bullish 8 Extremely Bullish Extremely Bullish 6 Extremely Bullish 5 Extremely Bullish 4 Strongly Bullish 3 Bullish Mildly Bullish 6 Neutral Neutral Neutral ~2 Mildly Bearish -3 Bearish -4 Strongly Bearish -5 Extremely Bearish -6 Extremely Bearish ~7 Extremely Bearish 8 Extremely Bearish 9 Extremely Bearish 10 Extremely Bearish Performance Record of the Wall Street Week (WSW) Technical Market Index Is Highly Significant The WSW Index '$ ability to forecast the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA was independently verified by Arthur A Merrill, CMT: Merrill examined all positive Or bullish index readings of +5 0 greater to determine whether O not the DJIA was higher 1, 5, 13,26 and 52 weeks later: Also, Merrill checked all negative or bearish index readings of _5 or to see whether or not the DJIA was lower 1,5,13,26 and 52 weeks later: For the 12.2-year period from October 18, 1974 (the date of WSW Index's first revision) through December 31, 1986, the WSW Index correctly forecasted the DJIA 58.59 of the time 1 week in advance; 62.6% of the time 5 weeks in advance; 70.4% of the time 13 weeks in advance; 79.5% of the time 26 weeks in advance; and 81.6% of the time 52 weeks in advance.

First, we number each of the 6 most recent past daily closing prices, such that the oldest data 5 days ago is numbered 1"; the data from 4 days ago is numbered 2" ; the data from 3 days ago is numbered 3" the data from 2 days ago is numbered "day 4" ; the data from 1 ago is numbered 5"; and the data from today is numbered 6"_ These assigned date position numbers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5,and 6) are our weights. 2_ these weights, multiply the daily closing price 5 days ago by 1; multiply the daily closing price 4 ago by 2; multiply the daily closing price 3 ago by 3; multiply the daily closing price 2 ago by 4; multiply the daily closing 1 ago by S;and multiply the daily closing price today by 6. 3. Sum the 6 products (from 2). In this example, the sum of products is 1135. 4. Add up the sum of the weights, which is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21. A shortcut formula for the sum of the weights is 0.5 X n X (n +1), where n is the number of observations. In this example, the sum of the weights is 0.5 X 6 X ( 6 + 1 ) = 21. 5. Divide the sum of products (from 3) by the sum of the weights (from 4). In this example, the sum of products divided by the sum of weights is 54. 6-day weighted moving average for a hypothetical stock sum of closing daily productsl price closing sum of from weights multiply equals products weights 5 ago 50 50 4 days ago 2 51 102 3 days ago 3 53 159 2 ago 5 1 56 224 day ag0 60 300 today 50 300 sums 28 1135 54 prices ~day ~day ~day day ~day ~day Using days days days price day Step Step Step price days days 790 Technical Market Indicators Using a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet to calculate a 6-month weighted moving average for the month-end NYSE Composite, and assuming the is in column B, the following formula is inserted into each cell of column H: = (B6*1+B7*2+B8*3+B9*4+B10*5+Bl*6)/21 6-month weighted moving average for the month-end NYSE Composite B D F H sum of month- moving products/ end closing sum of sum of row date price multiply_ weights equals products products weights 2/28/74 51.56 X 51.56 3/29/74 50.21 2 100.42 8 4/30/74 47.93 3 143.79 5/31/74 45.92 183.68 10 6/28/74 44.90 6 224.50 11 7/31/74 41.55 6 249.30 953.25 45.39 12 8/30/74 37.70 1 1 37.70 939.39 42.73 13 9/30/74 33.45 2 66.90 905.87 39.52 14 10/31/74 38.97 3 116.91 878.99 38.68 15 11/29/74 37.13 148.52 843.83 37.74 16 12/31/74 36.13 6 180.65 799.98 36.93 17 1/31/75 40.91 6 245.46 796.14 37.91 18 2/28/75 43.07 1 43.07 801.51 39.54 19 3/31/75 44.21 2 88.42 823.03 41.23 20 4/30/75 46.19 3 138.57 844.69 42.98 21 5/30/75 48.46 4 193.84 890.01 45.03 22 6/30/75 50.85 5 254.25 963.61 47.23 23 7/31/75 47.52 6 285.12 1003.27 47.77 24 8/29/75 46.29 46.29 1006.49 47.65 25 9/30/75 44.49 2 88.98 1007.05 46.86 26 10/31/75 47.05 3 141.15 1009.63 46.79 28 12/28/75 48.84  6 292.26 1902.76 47.02 29 1/30/76 53.55 6 321.30 1028.88 48.99 30 2/27/76 53.35 1 53.35 1035.94 50.56 31 3/31/76 54.80 2 109.60 1056.56 52.20 32 4/30/76 54.11 3 162.33 1077.74 53.15 33 5/31/76 53.31 4 213.24 1098.02 53.54 34 6/30/76 55.71 5 278.55 1138.37 54.38 35 7/30/76 55.26 6 331.56 1148.63 54.70 price Weighted Moving Average: Moving Position Weighted Arithmetic Mean 791 Indicator Strategy Example for Weighted Moving Average Crossover Strategy Based on daily closing for the DJIA from January 1900 to March 2001, we found that the following parameters would have produced a significantly positive re- sult on a purely mechanical trend-following signal basis with no subjectivity, no s0- phisticated technical analysis, and no judgement: Enter Long (Buy) at the current daily close of the DJIA when this close is greater than yesterday'$ 6-day weighted moving average of the daily closing prices.

System close drawdown is the largest decline in the cumulative equity line below the initial investment; based on closed-out positions only: System open drawdown (SODD) is the largest decline in [ the cumulative equity line below the initial investment when a position is open. Max open trade drawdown is the largest decline in the cumulative equity line below the trade entry price the worst single trade. The Profit/Loss Index is a complex calculation that relates the Amount of Winning Trades to the Amount of Losing Trades on a scale of 100 (worst possible performance) to 100 (best possible performance) , with zero representing profits equal to losses. Reward/Risk Index is the Total net profit minus System open drawdown. The resulting difference is then divided by the Total net profit: The Buy/Hold Indexis the Total net profit minus the buy-and-hold strategy's net profit: 3 resulting difference is then divided by the buy-and-hold net profit: In this exercise, initial equity is assumed to be $100_ Both long and short positions are taken unless otherwise noted: Trades are executed at the closing price on the signal date.

Assume we just ten indicators from this book and we choose to examine all combinations of these indicators_ We would have to examine ten to the 1Oth power number of combinations, Or ten billion combinations The number of possibilities mushrooms when we assign variable weights to different indicators, for example, ac- cording to their historical effectiveness. William Eckhardt (see Schwager; Jack, The New Market Wizards, Harper- Collins Publishers, 10 E. 53rd Street; New York; NY 10022, page 109), a trader and mathematician, stated that assigning weights tends to be assumption-laden regarding the relationship among the indicators. The literature on robust statistics implies that the best strategy is not some optimized weighting scheme, but rather weighting each indicator by 1 or 0. In other words, accept Or reject: If the indicator is enough to be used at all, it's enough to be weighted equally with the other ones If it is not enough, exclude it entirely: An alternate   approach is used by Arthur A_ Merrill, CMT, who has decades of experience as both a professional statistician and technical analyst. He ob- serves that at any given time some indicators are bullish while others are bearish, and it is only human nature to see only those that confirm preconceived opinion. Merrill's solution to this problem is to objectively weight the indicators by past performance. First; he measures each indicator by its accuracy in forecasting the direction of the DJIA over 1,5, 13, 26, and 52 weeks ahead, giving progressively greater weight to the longer time periods, which generally provide the most accurate forecasts. Merrill defines accuracy by the number of correct forecasts divided by the total number of forecasts. He further quantifies accuracy by the chi squared test of statistical signifi- cance with one degree of freedom. Merrill translates this significance data for all of his indicators into weights proportional to the of chi square, which is his own original innovation. Finally, he divides the sum of all bullish weights by the sums of all bullish plus all bearish weights for a totally objective weight of the statistical evi- dence he calls the Technical Trend Balance. Criteria for including, excluding, and weighting indicators should be based on the investor'$ objectives, logic and common sense, and historical risk-adjusted returns simulated over many decades of unseen historical data. Also, each component indi- cator should be analyzed and followed separately to allow the technical analyst to perceive possible changes in each indicator'$ behavior: On occasion, such changes have been substantial over time for some indicators, due to structural changes in the trading environment: pick _ good good good many logs About the Author 795 Wilder's Smoothing Wilder s Smoothing was developed by J.
