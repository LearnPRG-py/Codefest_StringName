Adaptive Moving Average An Adaptive Moving Average employs a continuously changing exponential moving average smoothing constant that increases as the price trend slope approaches the ver- tical and decreases as the price trend slope approaches zero. In other words, in a steep and accelerating price trend, the exponential moving average period length grows shorter or more sensitive to new data entering the calculation. In a flattening price trend, the exponential moving average period length grows longer or less sensitive to new data entering the calculation. Although the Adaptive Moving Average is an interesting newer idea with con- siderable intellectual appeal, our preliminary tests fail to show any real practical ad- vantage to this more complex trend smoothing method. After all, the data that determines the smoothing constant is still the same old past data that is used for any other smoothing method, so it is still looking into the rear-view mirror rather than into the ever unknowable future. Also, it is quite normal and common for steep price trends to pause and form minor continuation patterns, in which case an Adaptive Moving Average would be more likely to produce unprofitable whipsaws than a non- adaptive moving average. Finally, an Adaptive Moving Average is much more calcu- lation intensive so takes longer to compute, though this should become less of a consideration with ever faster computer hardware and software. Advance/Decline Divergence Oscillator (ADDO) A popular method of interpreting the Advance-Decline Line is to visually compare it to a market price index, such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). For exam- ple, if the Advance-Decline Line enters a falling trend while the DJIA is still in a ris- ing trend, such a negative divergence (sometimes) increases the probability of an eventual change to a bearish price trend, a move to the downside. There is usually a variable lead time, and another risk in this type of visual analysis judgment call is that subjectivity could creep in. Arthur A. Merrill, CMT, created his Advance/Decline Divergence Oscillator (ADDO) to bypass this risk of subjectivity. He calculates and interprets ADDO in ten steps. 1. 2. Convert daily breadth data to weekly data for all New York Stock Exchange issues in three sub-steps: sum the daily number of advancing issues for each day of the week; separately, sum the number of declining issues; and sum the number of unchanged issues for each day. Subtract the sum of declining issues from the sum of advancing issues. Re- spect the sign. This is net advancing issues. 60 Technical Market Indicators 3. Place that net difference in the numerator of a weekly (A D)/U ratio, which is the net advancing issues divided by the number of unchanged is- sues. Merrill credits Edmund Tabell for developing that indicator, which gives emphasis to the level of the market’s confidence (small unchanged) or indecisiveness (large unchanged). 4. Sum that weekly (A D)/U ratio’s values over the most recent trailing 52 weeks. This is a moving total of (A D)/U. 5. Using the weekly closing price of the DJIA and the moving sum of (A D)/U compute a linear regression of the two over the most recent 52 weeks. 6. Plot the regression line, with the DJIA on the Y axis and the moving sum of the (A D)/U ratio on the X axis. 7. To determine the expected value of the DJIA for a given value of the mov- ing sum (A D)/U ratio, locate the point on the regression line that is di- rectly above the current (A D)/U ratio value. 8. Express ADDO as the percentage deviation of the current closing price of the DJIA minus its expected value. 9. Positive deviations of DJIA versus its expected value increase bearish prob- abilities for the future. 10. Negative deviations of DJIA versus its expected value increase bullish probabilities for the future. Advance-Decline Line, A-D Line The Cumulative Daily Advance-Decline Line, perhaps the most widely known mar- ket breadth indicator, traditionally has been used to spot divergences relative to a gen- eral market price index, such as the S&P 500 or the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Most commonly, the Cumulative A-D Line is calculated as a running total of daily net advancing minus declining stock issues on the New York Stock Exchange. Similar indicators may be calculated for other markets, such as the NASDAQ, and weekly data also may be used. There are only two steps to compute this indicator. 1. From the number of advancing issues, subtract the number of declining is- sues each day, respecting sign. This is net advancing issues, and it is often a negative number. 2. Add that daily advances-declines difference to a cumulative total of the daily net advancing issues. This forms a continuous line that rises and falls with breadth trends on the NYSE. For example, our calculations for one month, from August 8 to September 8, 2000, are shown. These calculations are anchored to a starting value at the all-time low of the A-D Line on 12/24/74 set to zero. By starting on that date, we avoid handling negative Advance-Decline Line, A-D Line 61 cumulative numbers. Alternately, if one does not mind graphing large negative numbers, one could set the 12/24/74 low to 124,484, following the precedent of the Daily Stock Price Record, Standard & Poor’s, 25 Broadway, New York, NY 10004. Business libraries carry this data source.

Weekly data produces a much different looking cumulative line than the more popu- lar daily cumulative total. Technical analysts have long been aware that the most common subtraction cal- culation fails to compensate for a distortion that inflates the number of issues traded over the years, namely, the ever growing number of issues listed on the exchange. To regain analytical comparability over time, some analysts normalize the daily data, be- fore cumulating a running total, as follows: 62 Technical Market Indicators N (A D)/(A D) or T (A D)/(A D U) where N today’s 1-day ratio of net advances to total issues exhibiting any price change at all A number of advancing issues D number of declining issues T today’s 1-day ratio of net advances to total issues traded U number of unchanged issues A D U total number of issues traded each day Neither of these adjustments appear to make any substantial difference to the behavior of the basic A-D Line, however. A simple subtraction of declines from ad- vances has always been the most popular and widely used method of calculation. Interpretation of the Cumulative Daily Advance-Decline Line Trends and divergences of the Cumulative Daily Advance-Decline Line relative to a broad-based market price index have long been the most popular techniques of inter- pretation. (There may be a better way to view this data, however, as we shall see, be- low.) For example, if the market price index is rising at a time when the Cumulative Advance-Decline Line is declining, underlying market weakness is suggested, and that is a bearish warning, and sometimes an early warning, for stock prices. Con- versely, if the market price index is declining while the Cumulative Advance-Decline Line is rising, underlying market strength is evident, and that is a bullish indication for stock prices. The following table shows a traditional interpretation of the Ad- vance-Decline Line compared to a broad-based market price index, specifically, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (S&P). Interpretation of the Cumulative Advance-Decline Line Market Index (S&P 500) Advance-Decline Line Interpretation Rising Falling Bearish Near or at previous top Significantly below corresponding top Near or at previous top Significantly above corresponding top Falling Rising Bullish Near or at previous bottom Significantly above previous bottom Near or at previous bottom Significantly below previous bottom Bearish Bullish Bullish Bearish Advance-Decline Line, A-D Line 63 Indicator Strategy Example for the Cumulative Daily Advance-Decline Line The Cumulative Daily Advance-Decline Line can be an effective indicator on a purely objective basis. Based on a 68-year file of daily data for the number of shares advancing and declining each day on the New York Stock Exchange and the Dow- Jones Industrial Average since its all-time low of 41.22 on July 8, 1932, we found that the simplest possible trend-following rule would have produced a positive result on a purely mechanical signal basis with no subjectivity, no sophisticated technical analy- sis, and no judgement: Enter Long (Buy) at the current daily price close of the Dow-Jones In- dustrial Average when the Cumulative Daily Advance-Decline Line rises relative to its level the previous day. Close Long (Sell) at the current daily price close of the Dow-Jones Indus- trial Average when the Cumulative Daily Advance-Decline Line falls rel- ative to its level the previous day. Enter Short (Sell Short) at the current daily price close of the Dow-Jones Industrial Average when the Cumulative Daily Advance-Decline Line falls relative to its level the previous day. Close Short (Cover) at the current daily price close of the Dow-Jones In- dustrial Average when the Cumulative Daily Advance-Decline Line rises relative to its level the previous day. Starting with $100 and reinvesting profits, total net profits for this Cumulative Advance-Decline Line trend-following strategy would have been $822.4 million, as- suming a fully invested strategy, reinvestment of profits, no transactions costs, and no taxes. This would have been 3.08 million percent better than buy-and-hold. Even short selling would have been profitable. Trading would have been hyperactive with one trade every 3.49 calendar days. The Equis International MetaStock® System Testing rules, where the current Cumulative Daily A-D Line is inserted into the data field normally reserved for Vol- ume (V), are written as follows: Enter long: V Ref(V, 1) Close long: V Ref(V, 1) Enter short: V Ref(V, 1) Close short: V Ref(V, 1) Advance-Decline Line, A-D Line 67 Traditional methods of chart interpretation are only as good as the experience, judgement, and objectivity of the technician doing the analysis. A risk for the novice is that human judgement can be influenced by subjectivity, including position bias, which inclines the observer to interpret an indicator as bullish if he is long and bear- ish if he is short. Moreover, significant divergences between the Advance-Decline Line and a market price index are sometimes clear only in retrospect. The Cumulative Daily Advance-Decline Line has called every major mar- ket decline in history. The problem is that it has done nothing but call for major de- clines. A cursory glance at the accompanying graph illustrates the problem. At each of the nine junctures labeled on the graph, the Advance-Decline Line showed obvious negative divergences (in hindsight at least). The table, Nine Major A-D Divergences, shows the less-than-impressive results of these bearish warnings. A two-thirds major- ity of the Advance-Decline Line divergences proved to be ill timed or outright mis- leading from 1987 to 2000. Nine Major A-D Divergences Symbol Year Divergence Forecast Outcome Score 1 1987 Negative Bearish Right 1 2 1988 Negative Bearish Wrong 0 3 1990 Negative Bearish Right 1 4 1990 Negative Bearish Wrong 0 5 1991 Negative Bearish Wrong 0 6 1994 Negative Bearish Wrong 0 7 1995 Negative Bearish Wrong 0 8 1998 Negative Bearish Right 1 9 1999 Negative Bearish Wrong 0 Average 33% There have been few examples of positive divergences in the Advance-Decline Line relative to the major price indexes over the past 40 years—the years of the great- est bull market in history. The Advance-Decline Line topped out in 1959 and has re- mained mostly bearish ever since. This is a serious shortcoming of the standard divergence analysis approach to this data. Advance-Decline Ratio 75 The Equis International MetaStock® System Testing rules, where the current Percentage Hughes Breadth-Momentum Oscillator is inserted into the data field nor- mally reserved for Volume (V), are written as follows: Enter long: V Ref(Mov(V,opt1,E), 1) * (opt5/100) Close long: V Ref(Mov(V,opt2,E), 1) * (opt6/100) Enter short: V Ref(Mov(V,opt3,E), 1) * (opt7/100) Close short: V Ref(Mov(V,opt4,E), 1) * (opt8/100) OPT1 Current value: 12 OPT2 Current value: 2 OPT3 Current value: 8 OPT4 Current value: 46 OPT5 Current value: 92 OPT6 Current value: 104 OPT7 Current value: 104 OPT8 Current value: 92 Advance/Decline Ratio The Advance/Decline Ratio is a breadth-momentum oscillator calculated by first di- viding the number of advancing issues by the number of declining issues each day; and then by smoothing the previously derived fraction by using a moving average to tame some of the erratic daily movement. The basic calculation before smoothing is given by the following formula: R A/D where R today’s 1-day ratio of advancing issues to declining issues A number of advancing issues D number of declining issues Indicator Strategy Example of the Advance/Decline Ratio Oscillator The Advance/Decline Ratio is a useful indicator even without any data smoothing or other manipulation. Based on a 68-year file of daily data for the number of shares ad- vancing and declining each day on the New York Stock Exchange and the Dow-Jones 78 Technical Market Indicators Industrial Average since March 8, 1932, we found that a simple crossover, trend- following rule would have produced a positive result on a purely mechanical signal basis with no subjectivity, no sophisticated technical analysis, and no judgement: Enter Long (Buy) at the current daily price close of the Dow-Jones In- dustrial Average when the Advance/Decline Ratio rises to cross above 1.018. Close Long (Sell) at the current daily price close of the Dow-Jones Indus- trial Average when the Advance/Decline Ratio falls to cross below 1.018. Enter Short (Sell Short) at the current daily price close of the Dow-Jones Industrial Average when the Advance/Decline Ratio falls to cross below 1.018. Close Short (Cover) at the current daily price close of the Dow-Jones In- dustrial Average when the Advance/Decline Ratio rises to cross above 1.018. Starting with $100 and reinvesting profits, total net profits for this Advance/De- cline Ratio trend-following strategy would have been $884,717,056, assuming a fully invested strategy, reinvestment of profits, no transactions costs and no taxes. This would have been 7,055,813.92 percent better than buy-and-hold. Even short selling would have been profitable. Trading would have been hyperactive with one trade every 3.47 calendar days. The Equis International MetaStock® System Testing rules, where the current Advance/Decline Ratio multiplied by 1000 (to avoid handling fractions) is inserted into the data field normally reserved for Volume (V), are written as follows: Enter long: Mov(V,opt1,E) opt2 Close long: Mov(V,opt1,E) opt2 Enter short: Mov(V,opt1,E) opt2 Close short: Mov(V,opt1,E) opt2 OPT1 Current value: 1 OPT2 Current value: 1018 Advisory Sentiment Index This indicator may refer to any one of four different sentiment polls or surveys con- ducted by investment advisory service newsletters and is generally made available to 82 Technical Market Indicators Indicator Strategy Example for Advisory Sentiment Bears, with a Bullishly Skewed Decision Rule This skewed strategy would not have spent much time on the short side, but when short it would have been profitable on balance. That is, for those brief periods when there were an extraordinary proportion of bears, the market performed poorly. Based on a 38-year file of weekly data for Advisory Sentiment Bears and the Dow-Jones In- dustrial Average from 1/28/62 to 12/29/00, we found a bullishly skewed decision rule that would have been profitable on a purely mechanical contrary signal basis with no subjectivity, no sophisticated technical analysis, and no judgement: Enter Long (Buy) at the current weekly price close of the Dow-Jones In- dustrial Average when the current level of Advisory Sentiment Bears is less than its previous week’s 54-week exponential moving average plus 10 percentage points. Close Long (Sell) at the current weekly price close of the Dow-Jones Industrial Average when the current level of Advisory Sentiment Bears is greater than its previous week’s 54-week exponential moving average plus 10 percentage points. Enter Short (Sell Short) at the current weekly price close of the Dow- Jones Industrial Average when the current level of Advisory Sentiment Bears is greater than its previous week’s 54-week exponential moving av- erage plus 10 percentage points. Close Short (Cover) at the current weekly price close of the Dow-Jones Industrial Average when the current level of Advisory Sentiment Bears is less than its previous week’s 54-week exponential moving average plus 10 percentage points. Starting with $100 and reinvesting profits, total net profits for this Advisory Sentiment Bears bullishly skewed strategy would have been $2,649.57, assuming a fully invested strategy, reinvestment of profits, no transactions costs, and no taxes. This would have been 70.27% better than buy-and-hold. Even short selling would have been profitable, and it was included in the strategy. The indicator would have given profitable buy signals only 46.72% of the time. Trading would have been rela- tively inactive at one trade every 113.79 calendar days. Although the majority of sig- nals wound have been unprofitable, note that the average winning trade would have been 6.61 times as large as the average losing trade.

American Association of Individual Investors Survey The American Association of Individual Investors (AAII), of Chicago, IL, mails 25 survey postcards daily asking small retail investors their opinions of the stock market for the next six months. This indicator is one of four different sentiment polls or sur- veys conducted by investment advisory service newsletters, which are generally made available to subscribers via telephone recording. After a moderate time lag, the data is also printed in Barron’s weekly financial newspaper, which is available every Sat- urday. Popular interpretation is generally contrarian. (See Contrary Opinion and Ad- visory Service Sentiment.) Opinion polls can be tricky to interpret, and they are useful more for background than for precise timing. Over an 11-year period measured, Ned Davis Research found extraordinarily high returns when a 2-week smoothing of this data falls to 44% bulls, indicating ex- treme pessimism. Below-average returns followed when the smoothing moved above 61%, indicating excessive optimism. 92 Technical Market Indicators Enter Short (Sell Short) at the current daily price close of the Dow-Jones Industrial Average when EMV smoothed by a 4-period exponential mov- ing average falls below zero. Close Short (Cover) at the current daily price close of the Dow-Jones In- dustrial Average when EMV smoothed by a 4-period exponential moving average rises above zero. Starting with $100 and reinvesting profits, total net profits for this EMV strat- egy would have been $230,805.78, assuming a fully invested strategy, reinvestment of profits, no transactions costs and no taxes. This would have been 4,944.66 percent better than buy-and-hold. Short selling, which was included in this strategy, would have lost money since March, 1980, but nevertheless would have been profitable over the entire 72-years as a whole.

Arms, Jr. (Arms Advisory, 800 Wagontrain Drive S. E., Albuquerque, NM 87102). Arms’ Index is also commonly referred to by its quote machine symbols, TRIN and MKDS. Mathematically, Arms’ Index is calculated as follows: (Advances/Declines)/(Advancing Volume/Declining Volume) Thus, Arms’ Index is calculated using four numbers combined into three ratios. These three ratios use four numbers derived from closing price and volume data for all issues traded each day on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). This data is readily available from online sources such as Reuters. Also, the data is published in many daily newspapers. For example, in the Wall Street Journal, this data appears on page C2, under STOCK MARKET DATA BANK, DIARIES, NYSE. The four required numbers are: Arms’ Short-Term Trading Index (TRIN, MKDS) 93 • Advances, or advancing issues, are the number of NYSE listed stocks with a positive, upward price change for the day; • Declines, or declining issues, are the number of NYSE listed stocks with a negative, downward price change for the day; • zAdv vol (000), the volume of advancing issues, or Advancing Volume; and • zDec vol (000), the volume of declining issues, or Declining Volume. After gathering this data, the Arms’ Index is computed in three steps: 1. Divide the number of advancing issues by the number of declining issues; that is, Advances/Declines; 2. Divide the volume of advancing issues by the volume of declining issues; that is, zAdv vol/zDec vol; 3. Divide the ratio obtained in Step 1 by the ratio obtained in Step 2; that is, (Advances/Declines)/(zAdv vol/zDec vol). Arms’ Index effectively quantifies the intensity of buying pressure relative to the intensity of selling pressure for the market as a whole. We found that both ex- tremely high Arms’ Index levels greater than 1.444 and extremely low Arms’ Index levels of 0.523 or less were bullish and statistically significant at the 99% confidence level over a 1-year holding period (or forward window of time). This means that there was less than an one in 100 probability that the stock market rose by chance alone af- ter extreme readings in the daily Arm’s Index. Although at first impression it may seem odd that both extremely high and ex- tremely low levels would be bullish, we can understand this as we reflect on how markets bottom and reverse trend. Important trend reversals are characterized by extreme swings in market sentiment. First, sentiment is extremely bearish as the market falls (to extremely oversold) at the end of a substantial market price drop. When selling is exhausted, meaning everyone who can sell has already sold, selling pressure dries up, and bargain hunters move in. Prices start to move up causing short sellers to cut losses, and portfolio managers must quickly jump on board the rise so they will not fall behind their performance benchmarks. A powerful rebound effect emerges from the ruins left by the bear. There is a price reversion to the mean (for example, to a 50-day or 200-day moving average), or perhaps beyond. The sudden imbalance of buying pressure over selling pressure produces distorted ratios of buy- ing relative to selling at the beginning of a new bull wave. Thus, extremely high and extremely low levels of the Arms’ Index are both bullish, first with high levels on the panic selling climax then followed by low levels on the one-sided, snap-back rally. Intense selling pressure was bullish. If there was significantly more selling pres- sure than buying pressure on any given day, the Arms’ Index rose to 1.444 or higher, and it was probable at the 99% confidence level that the market would be higher in a year. 94 Technical Market Indicators Intense buying pressure was bullish. If there was significantly more buying pressure than selling pressure on any given day, the Arms’ Index fell to 0.523 or lower, and it was probable at the 99% confidence level that the market would be higher in 6-month and 1-year holding periods. For shorter-term forward time win- dows of 1 month and 3 months, readings of 0.523 or lower also were bullish, but at the lesser 95% confidence level. Arms’ Index levels above 0.523, but below 1.444, had no statistical significance. Technical analysts traditionally have smoothed raw data with their standard 10- period simple moving average of the daily readings. They have done this in order to even out erratic day-to-day movements. The results of 10-day simple moving aver- ages greater than 1.266 were very bullish over 1-year holding periods (forward time windows). These results were statistically highly significant at the 99.9% confidence level, which means that there was less than an one in 1000 probability that the stock market rose by chance alone after a high 10-day Arms’ Index reading in excess of 1.266. The following table, Out-of-Sample Simulation for Arms’ 10-day SMA 1.266, shows out-of-sample testing without hindsight bias. It shows all of the com- pleted round-turn long trades signaled by Arms’ Index 10-day simple moving average greater than 1.266. (The 1988 edition of this book established these specific parame- ters.) Because these parameters were established on available data before 1987, the performance statistics in the table represent a simulation of what realistically might have been achieved using this indicator, excluding transactions costs, taxes and divi- dends. An initial $100.00 would have grown to $454.95 without a losing trade. Note that in our testing, a repeated buy signal (that is, Arm’s 10-day SMA 1.266) within one year of the previous buy signal extended the 1-year holding period to one year from the repeated buy signal. Thus, a series of repeated buy signals ex- tended the holding period substantially. For example, the long-side trade that was opened on 10/16/87 remained open more than 5 years until 12/3/92 because of re- peated buy signals before the previous buy signal was yet one year old. Note also that the actual reading of Arms’ Index on 7/16/86 was 1.2663, which rounds down to 1.266, but is actually greater than 1.266, as our strict decision rule demands.

Arms’ Short-Term Trading Index (TRIN, MKDS) 95 Our original testing method divided Arm’s Index readings for the 59-year test period from January 1928 to March 1987 into 20 ranges with approximately the same number of occurrences in each range. For each reading in a range, the gain or loss in four subsequent time periods (1 month later, 3 months later, 6 months later, and 12 months later) was calculated. The combined results for readings within each range were statistically compared, using chi-squared tests, to the performance of the over- all market (as measured by the Standard & Poor’s 500). Varying degrees of bullish and bearish significance were noted on the basis of that comparison. Countless variations for manipulating this fascinating indicator are too numerous to test here. The ‘Open 10 TRIN’ or ‘Open 10 Trading Index’ is calculated by dividing a ratio of a 10-day total of the number of advancing issues to a 10-day total of the num- ber of declining issues by a ratio of a 10-day total of volume of advancing issues to a 10- day total of the volume of declining issues. The ‘Open 30 TRIN’ or ‘Open 30 Trading Index’ are similar, and they use 30-day totals. Analysts have experimented with Fi- bonacci numbers, other number progressions and optimization for the day totals, and they have varied the signal threshold levels in a wide variety of increments, not neces- sarily symmetrically, since observed raw data are not distributed symmetrically around the balanced ratio of 1.00. A single day’s Arms’ Index reading at 2.65 and higher was found to be a use- ful threshold in 1986. (See Alphier, J., & Kuhn, B., ‘A helping hand from the Arms Index,’ Technical Analysis of Stocks & Commodities, Vol. 5:4, pp. 142–143, www.traders.com.) If we bought the S&P 500 Composite Stock Price Index on the close of every day when the Arms’ Index was 2.65 or higher and held for one year, we would have made a profit 11 out of 12 times over the past 35 years: 92% of the signals were profitable. Because these parameters were established on available data before 1987, the performance statistics in the table on trades closed out after 1987 represent a simulation of what realistically might have been achieved using this indicator, excluding transac- tions costs, taxes and dividends. An initial $100.00 in 1986 would have grown to $273.25 without a losing trade. Like our Arms’ Index 10-day simple moving average greater than 1.266 rule, 100% accuracy in a 14-year, out-of-sample simulation with dif- ferent parameters suggests that the underlying idea behind the Arms’ Index may well be worthwhile. Note that in our testing a repeated buy signal (that is, an Arm’s Index 1-day reading greater than 2.65), within one year of the previous buy signal, extended the 1- year holding period to one year from the repeated buy signal. Thus, a series of re- peated buy signals extended the holding period substantially. For example, the long-side trade opened on 7/7/86 and remained open more than 5 years until 10/10/91 because of repeated buy signals before the previous buy signal was yet one year old. 96 Technical Market Indicators Updated Arms’ Index 2.65, Out-of-Sample Since 10/14/86 Arms’ Date S&P 500 1 Yr.

Shorter-term trading with the Arms’ Index is an irresistible temptation. After all, the full name of the indicator is ‘the Arms’ Short-Term Trading Index.’ In the real- world, few traders would have the patience to hold for a year based on a historical study of the data. We searched for a mechanical long and short decision rule that would be adap- tive to the current action of the market. Based on a 16-year file of daily data for the Arms’ Short-Term Trading Index, and for an adjusted series of price data for the S&P 500 Depositary Receipts from inception in 1993 and the S&P futures from 1984 to 1993, we found that the following parameters would have produced a positive result on a purely mechanical signal basis with no subjectivity, no sophisticated technical analysis, and no judgement: Enter Long (Buy) at the current daily price close when the 11-day expo- nential moving average of the daily Arms’ Short-Term Trading Index is greater than 0.800. Close Long (Sell) at the current daily price close when the 11-day expo- nential moving average of the daily Arms’ Short-Term Trading Index is less than 0.800. Sell Long and Sell Short at the current daily price close when the 11-day exponential moving average of the daily Arms’ Short-Term Trading Index is less than 0.800. Arms’ Short-Term Trading Index (TRIN, MKDS) 97 Cover Short and Buy Long at the current daily price close when the 11-day exponential moving average of the daily Arms’ Short-Term Trading Index is greater than 0.800. Starting with $100 and reinvesting profits, total net profits for this strategy would have been $1,640.39, with 77.13% winning trades, assuming a fully invested strategy, reinvestment of profits, no transactions costs and no taxes. This would have been 80.47% better than buy-and-hold. Also, the worst drawdowns would have been milder than buy-and-hold. The Equis International MetaStock® System Testing rules are written as follows, with the Arms’ Short-Term Trading Index multiplied by 1000 and placed in the data field normally reserved for volume: Enter long: Mov(V,opt1,E) opt2 Close long: Mov(V,opt1,E) opt2 Enter short: Mov(V,opt1,E) opt2 Close short: Mov(V,opt1,E) opt2 OPT1 Current value: 11 OPT2 Current value: 800 Also, the exact same parameters outperformed buy-and-hold using Dow-Jones Industrial Average daily data over the same 16 years from 1984 to 2000, as shown in the final table for this topic. 114 Technical Market Indicators Black-Box Systems These are proprietary indicators offered without documentation. The algorithm or for- mula needed to calculate the result is not divulged. The quite understandable business reason for such non-disclosure is to preserve the uniqueness of the analysis, to pre- vent widespread imitation, and to maintain trade secrets. Unfortunately for the user, however, such secrecy also prevents him from understanding and developing confi- dence in the indicator output. If a trader cannot understand exactly what an indicator is saying and why, then he is likely to abandon all discipline based on such an indica- tor after a few losing signals. Although strings of losing signals are common to most indicators, good indicators overcome this problem if the trader sticks with the disci- pline of following every signal. But such persistence is less likely with a black box. Also, if the underlying assumptions on which the indicator relies should be changed by any powerful external development, the user would not be equipped to compre- hend a problem before substantial losses are incurred. Furthermore, relying on a pro- prietary indicator does not contribute to intellectual development, enhanced trading skills or growth of wisdom of its user. Therefore, most thoughtful technicians avoid all proprietary indicators. There are, after all, many interesting and useful concepts to explore that are fully available for thorough analysis. And, no matter if an indicator is accepted or rejected, a thorough analysis of the workings and the past performance of an indicator offers beneficial insights into the nature of market movements. Bollinger Bands This popular indicator is similar to the older moving average envelope. It was devel- oped by John A. Bollinger, CFA, CMT, Bollinger Capital Management, Inc., PO Box 3358, Manhattan Beach, CA 90266, (310) 798-8855, www.bollingerbands.com. In contrast to the moving average envelope, instead of plotting a ‘resistance’ line some fixed percentage above a moving average and another ‘support’ line the same fixed percentage below a moving average, Bollinger plots a resistance line two standard deviations above and a support line two standard deviations below a 20-day simple moving average. Bollinger Bands are versatile and can be adapted to any time frame, from min- utes to months. They are designed to quickly react to large moves in the market, and to show whether prices are high or low relative to normal trading ranges. Bollinger uses his bands with other indicators to confirm price action. Bollinger suggests the 20-day simple moving average with plus and minus two standard deviations to be descriptive of the intermediate-term trend. These have be- come the most popular default settings. For analysis of the short-term trend, Bollinger suggests a 10-day simple moving average with one and a half standard deviations. For Bollinger Bands 115 analysis of the long-term trend, Bollinger suggests a 50-day simple moving average with two and a half standard deviations. Bollinger notes that the moving average length should be descriptive of the cho- sen time frame, and that this moving average is almost always a different length than the one that proves most useful for crossover buys and sells. Also, Bollinger suggests that a way to identify an appropriate moving average length is to choose one that pro- vides support to the correction of the first move up off a bottom. If the average is pen- etrated by the correction, then the average is too short; and if the correction falls short of the average, then the average is too long. The moving average ought to provide support far more often than it is broken. Bollinger does not recommend applying his Bands for absolute buy and sell sig- nals when price touches or crosses the Bands. Rather, he uses Bands to provide a framework within which price may be related to other, independent technical indica- tors, such as on-balance volume or money flow. For example, if price touches the up- per band and the chosen independent technical indicator confirms such price strength, no sell signal is generated—instead a continuation buy confirmation is recognized. On the other hand, if price tags the upper band and the independent indicator does not confirm such price strength (that is, the indicator diverges negatively), a sell signal is recognized. Another example of a sell signal is after a series of higher price highs, all pushing to or outside the upper band, a final new price high is unable to meet the up- per band, thus indicating a loss of upward price momentum and offering a sell signal. A mirror-image analysis would apply to the use of the lower bands for recog- nizing buy signals. For example, if price touches the lower band and the chosen in- dependent technical indicator confirms such price weakness, no buy signal is generated, but instead, a continuation sell confirmation is recognized. On the other hand, if price tags the lower band and the independent indicator does not confirm such price weakness (that is, the indicator diverges positively), a buy signal is recog- nized. Another example of a buy signal is after a series of lower price lows, all push- ing to or below the lower band, a final new price low is unable to meet the lower band, thus indicating a loss of downward price momentum and offering a buy signal. Indicator Strategy Example for Bollinger Bands Bollinger Bands require experience and judgement to use as Bollinger intended. But even naïve testing assumptions suggest that Bollinger Bands may have some objec- tive potential value as a purely mechanical, contra-trend technical indicator. The great majority of oversold buy signals would have been profitable. Moreover, these buy signals would have been robust, with all simple moving average lengths from 6 to 50 days, minus and plus two standard-deviations, profitable and right most of the time, again for long trades only. 116 Technical Market Indicators As attractive as a high percentage of profitable trades may seem, it is important to note that this, like other contra-trend strategies, failed to provide any protection in the Crash of ’87, the decline of 1998, and other market price drops. As the chart shows, there are sharp equity drawdowns. Using Bollinger Bands for contra-trend oversold and overbought signals would have underperformed the passive buy-and- hold strategy. Short selling would not have been profitable in the past. Based on a 18-year file of daily data for the entire history of the S&P 500 Com- posite Stock Price Index futures CSI Perpetual Contract from 4/21/82 to 12/08/00 collected from www.csidata.com, we found that the following parameters, suggested by Bollinger, would have produced profits most of the time (for long-side trades only) on a purely mechanical overbought/oversold signal basis with no subjectivity, no so- phisticated technical analysis, and no judgement: Enter Long (Buy) at the current daily price close when the S&P 500 Composite Stock Price Index CSI Perpetual Contract closing price is less than the current 10-day simple moving average of the daily closing prices minus two standard deviations. Close Long (Sell) at the current daily price close when the S&P 500 Com- posite Stock Price Index CSI Perpetual Contract closing price is greater than the current 10-day simple moving average of the daily closing prices plus two standard deviations. Enter Short (Sell Short) never. Starting with $100 and reinvesting profits, total net profits for this Bollinger Bands counter-trend strategy would have been $678.60, assuming a fully invested strategy, reinvestment of profits, no transactions costs, and no taxes. This would have been 35.10 percent less than buy-and-hold. No short selling would have been prof- itable, and no short selling was included in the strategy. Short selling would have cut the profit in half. Although this strategy would have not kept pace with the passive buy-and-hold strategy, the long-only Bollinger Bands as an indicator would have given profitable buy signals 88.61% of the time. Trading would have been relatively inactive at one trade every 86.16 calendar days. Note that this strategy considers clos- ing prices only, while ignoring intraday highs and lows. The Equis International MetaStock® System Testing rules are written as follows: Enter long: CLOSE BBandBot(CLOSE,opt1,S,opt2) Close long: CLOSE BBandTop(CLOSE,opt1,S,opt2) OPT1 Current value: 10 OPT2 Current value: 2 120 Technical Market Indicators %b Based on Bollinger Bands and inspired by the formula for Stochastics, John Bollinger, CFA, CMT, developed %b as a price-momentum oscillator. Just as Sto- chastics quantifies the position of the latest price close within its recent price range, so %b quantifies the position of the latest price close within the Bollinger Bands. But, unlike Stochastics, which is bounded by 0 and 100, %b moves beyond these bound- aries when prices are outside of the bands. • %b below 0 is below the lower band. • %b at 0 is at the lower band. • %b at 50 is mid-way between the upper and lower bands. • %b at 100 is at the upper band. • %b above 100 is above the upper band. The %b indicator can be used for overbought/oversold signals, and %b invites comparison to the price itself and to other indicators for confirmation and divergence analysis. Bollinger Band Width Index The Bollinger Band Width Index is four times the 20-day standard deviation of the daily price closes. According to John A. Bollinger, CFA, CMT, volatility is cyclical, and unusually low volatility periods alternate with periods of unusually high volatil- ity. The Bollinger Band Width Index quantifies this volatility. Bollinger uses it to identify periods of unusual and unsustainable volatility, which can lead to the oppo- site condition. For example, Bollinger notes that a drop in band width below 2% for the Standard & Poor’s 500 has led to large moves. Also, Bollinger uses Band Width to identify the end of trends. The Bollinger Band Width Index is given by the follow- ing: Bollinger Band Width Index (UpperBB LowerBB)/MiddleBB where the UpperBB is the moving average of close plus two standard deviations, the LowerBB is the moving average of close minus two standard deviations, and the MiddleBB is the moving average itself. Assuming the default parameters suggested by John Bollinger of plus or minus two standard deviation bands around a 20-day simple moving average, the above for- mula reduces to: Bollinger Band Width Index (4 * 20-day sigma)/20-day mean where sigma is the 20-day standard deviation of the closing price around the 20-day simple moving average. 128 Technical Market Indicators Bullish Consensus Consensus, Inc., of Kansas City, MO, offers one of four different sentiment polls (surveys conducted by investment advisory service newsletters) and is available to subscribers via telephone recording. After a moderate time lag the data is also printed in Barron’s weekly financial newspaper, which is available every Saturday. Popular interpretation is generally contrarian. (See Contrary Opinion and Advisory Service Sentiment.) Bullish Consensus is tabulation of market opinions expressed in published mar- ket letters distributed widely by futures brokers and advisors. Opinions are quantified, weighed by influence, and interpreted as follows: 90%–100% excessive optimism, extremely overbought, an end to the uptrend is imminent 80%–90% unbalanced optimism, overbought, a downside reversal is possible 60%–80% moderate, an uptrend can continue; but if near a bottom look for new lows 50%–60% neutral 30%–50% moderate, a downtrend can continue; but if near a top look for new highs 20%–30% unbalanced pessimism, an upside reversal is possible 0%–20% excessive pessimism, an end to the downtrend is imminent Contrary opinion is a popular idea, known even to television commentators, whose general level of understanding of technical analysis is superficial at best. Many experienced technical analysts use sentiment, but more as a supplement to trend, mo- mentum, and other technical indicators than as a stand-alone, signal generator. Senti- ment typically shows overbought and oversold levels well before the directional price move is over and, therefore, can be misleading. In general, sentiment is more of a background indicator that is not suitable for precise timing. As the chart shows, over the 14-year period, Ned Davis found extraordinarily high returns of 25.1% per annum when data fell below its lower dynamic bracket (See Bollinger Bands), indicating excessive pessimism. Interestingly, using both extremes for buy and sell signals produced long-only returns only 6% greater than buy-and- hold. 130 Technical Market Indicators Call-Put Dollar Value Flow Line (CPFL) The Call-Put Dollar Value Flow Line (CPFL) is a sentiment and price-direction con- firmation indicator created by Robert B. McCurtain. It may be computed using daily or weekly data. McCurtain designed CPFL to reflect the direction option money is flowing. The relative importance of an options transaction needs to be weighted by the dollar value of the transaction—that is, price times volume. In contrast, conventional Call-Put analysis treats all call and put volume equally; that is, 1000 contracts of an option trading at 1/16 has the same importance as 1000 contracts of an option priced at 25. McCurtain corrects this error by multiplying the option price by the option volume to arrive at the dollar value of the transaction. One thousand contracts at 25 would have a dollar value of $250,000, which is 400 times greater than the dollar value of $6,250 for the option at 1/16. Assuming that the option at 1/16 is more likely to reflect the hopes of a wild gambler, while the option at 25 is more likely to reflect the considered strategy of a serious professional, McCurtain’s price times volume weighting places the emphasis where it belongs. If stock volume leads price, and option volume offers further clues to future stock price movements, then McCurtain reasoned that when CPFL starts a new trend before the price of the underlying issue, the stock price should follow. Also, if the stock price rallies to new highs while CPFL fails to rise, option dollar flows are rela- tively weak, and price strength should not continue. Similarly, if the stock price falls to new lows and CPFL does not confirm that price weakness by also making new lows, option dollar flows are relatively strong, and the stock price decline should be temporary. McCurtain’s Call-Put Dollar Value Flow Line (CPFL) may be computed in seven steps: 1. Collect end-of-day closing price and volume data for all call and all put op- tions of the underlying stock, index, or commodity to be analyzed. Since most publications do not publish complete details for all options, McCurtain collects his data electronically for all strike prices and all maturities for each issue. 2. Multiply each call option’s volume by its closing price. 3. Sum the products (from Step 2) for each call option for each issue to arrive at the day’s Call Dollar Value. 4. 5. Multiply each put option’s volume by its closing price. Sum the products (from Step 4) for each put option for each issue to arrive at the day’s Put Dollar Value. Call-Put Dollar Value Flow Line (CPFL) 131 6. Subtract the Put Dollar Value from the Call Dollar Value, for the Net Call- Put Dollar Value. Respect the sign, so if Call Dollar Value is less than Put Dollar Value, the Net Call-Put Dollar Value will carry a minus sign. 7. Calculate a cumulative total of the Net Call-Put Dollar Values (from Step 6). This cumulative total will rise when Call Dollar Value is greater than Put Dollar Value, and it will decline when Call Dollar Value is less than Put Dol- lar Value. Indicator Strategy Example for McCurtain’s Call-Put Dollar Value Flow Line Historical data shows that the Call-Put Dollar Value Flow Line can offer accurate sig- nals on the long side. Based on the weekly call and put data for S&P 100 Stock Price Index and the Dow-Jones Industrial Average for 18 years from March 1983 to Janu- ary 2001, we found that the following parameters would have produced (for long trades only) a moderately positive result on a purely mechanical trend-following sig- nal basis with no subjectivity, no sophisticated technical analysis, and no judgement: Enter Long (Buy) at the current weekly price close of the Dow-Jones In- dustrial when the weekly Call-Put Dollar Value Flow Line crosses above its previous week’s trailing 114-week Exponential Moving Average of the weekly Call-Put Dollar Value Flow Line. Close Long (Sell) at the current weekly price close of the Dow-Jones In- dustrial when the weekly Call-Put Dollar Value Flow Line crosses below its previous week’s trailing 114-week Exponential Moving Average of the weekly Call-Put Dollar Value Flow Line. Enter Short (Sell Short) never. Starting with $100 and reinvesting profits, total net profits for this Call-Put Dol- lar Value Flow Line strategy would have been $832.45, assuming a fully invested strategy, reinvestment of profits, no transactions costs and no taxes. This would have been 12.94 percent less than buy-and-hold. Short selling was not included in this strategy and would have lowered total net profit by 2.69%. The long-only Call-Put Dollar Value Flow Line would have given profitable buy signals 3 times out of 3. Trading would have been inactive at one trade every 2,963.67 calendar days. The Equis International MetaStock® System Testing rules, where the Call-Put Dollar Value Flow Line is inserted in the field normally reserved for volume, are writ- ten as follows: Enter long: V Ref(Mov(V,opt1,E), 1) Close long: V Ref(Mov(V,opt1,E), 1) 134 Technical Market Indicators Enter short: V Ref(Mov(V,opt1,E), 1) Close short: V Ref(Mov(V,opt1,E), 1) OPT1 Current value: 114 Call-Put Dollar Value Ratio The Call-Put Dollar Value Ratio is a sentiment oscillator created by Robert B. McCurtain. It may be computed using daily or weekly data. This ratio can be scaled to oscillate up and down around 100, within a range of zero to 200. To calculate, normalize and scale this Call-Put Dollar Value Ratio, start with Steps 1 through 6 for the Call-Put Dollar Value Flow Line. 7. Divide the net difference of Call Dollar Value minus Put Dollar Value by the sum of Call Dollar Value plus Put Dollar Value. 8. Multiply the ratio in Step 7 by 100, to arrive at the percentage of net call- put dollar volume relative to the total call plus put dollar volume. 9. Add the product of Step 8 to a constant of 100 (for scaling). 10. Compute a 3-period Exponential Moving Average of the weekly sums in Step 9. 11. Plot that 3-period Exponential Moving Average. Indicator Strategy Example for McCurtain’s Call-Put Dollar Value Ratio Historical data shows that the Call-Put Dollar Value Ratio can be an effective indica- tor on both the long and short sides, and particularly on the long side. Based on the weekly call and put data for S&P 100 Stock Price Index and the Dow-Jones Industrial Average for 17 years from January 1984 to January 2001, we found that the follow- ing parameters would have produced a significantly positive result on a purely me- chanical trend-following signal basis with no subjectivity, no sophisticated technical analysis, and no judgement: Enter Long (Buy) at the current weekly price close of the Dow-Jones In- dustrial Average when 3-period Exponential Moving Average of the weekly sums (from Step 10) rises from below to above 60. Close Long (Sell) at the current weekly price close of the Dow-Jones In- dustrial Average when 3-period Exponential Moving Average of the weekly sums (from Step 10) falls from above to below 61. Call-Put Dollar Value Ratio 135 Enter Short (Sell Short) at the current weekly price close of the Dow- Jones Industrial Average when 3-period Exponential Moving Average of the weekly sums (from Step 10) falls from above to below 61. Close Short (Cover) at the current weekly price close of the Dow-Jones Industrial Average when 3-period Exponential Moving Average of the weekly sums (from Step 10) rises from below to above 52. Starting with $100 and reinvesting profits, total net profits for this Call-Put Dol- lar Value Ratio strategy would have been $1,469.11, assuming a fully invested strat- egy, reinvestment of profits, no transactions costs and no taxes. This would have been 101.65 percent better than buy-and-hold. Short selling, which was included in this strategy, would have lost money since October, 1990, but would have been profitable over the entire 17 years. The long-and-short Call-Put Dollar Value Ratio would have given profitable signals 60.98% of the time. Trading would have been more active but still modest at one trade every 151.98 calendar days. The Equis International MetaStock® System Testing rules, where the pre- smoothed Call-Put Dollar Value Ratio is inserted in the field normally reserved for volume, are written as follows: Enter long: Ref(Mov(V,opt1,E), 1) opt2 AND Mov(V,opt1,E) opt2 Close long: Ref(Mov(V,opt1,E), 1) opt3 AND Mov(V,opt1,E) opt3 Enter short: Ref(Mov(V,opt1,E), 1) opt4 AND Mov(V,opt1,E) opt4 Close short: Ref(Mov(V,opt1,E), 1) opt5 AND Mov(V,opt1,E) opt5 OPT1 Current value: 3 OPT2 Current value: 60 OPT3 Current value: 61 OPT4 Current value: 61 OPT5 Current value: 52 Combining Multiple Technocal Indicators 153 Combining Multiple Technical Indicators Criteria for including, excluding, and weighting indicators in combinations should be based on the investor’s objectives, logic, common sense, and historical risk-adjusted returns simulated over many decades of unseen historical data. Also, each component indicator should be analyzed and followed separately to allow the technical analyst to perceive possible changes in each indicator’s behavior, which have been substantial over time for some indicators, due to structural changes in the trading environment. An overwhelmingly large number of possible technical indicator combinations exist. For example, assume we pick just 10 indicators from this book and we choose to examine all combinations of these indicators. We would need to examine 10 to the 10th power number of combinations, or 10 billion combinations. Commodex Trend Index is an example of how complex indicator combinations can become. This index employs crossovers of a fast and a slow moving average, vol- ume and open interest momentum for trend confirmation, a trading band for a stop, overbought/oversold levels for profit taking, liquidation based on money manage- ment, and inverse pyramiding. Moreover, the components of the system are weighted differently, with the longer term elements given greater weight. There are many other combined indicator systems that are even more complex. And the more complex the indicator combinations, the more difficult the final system is to comprehend and to work with. It is quite easy to combine different indicators in a way that prevents understanding of how the combination actually works. Moreover, a chain of indicators is no stronger than its weakest link. The number of possibilities mushrooms when we assign variable weights to dif- ferent indicators. William Eckhardt, a trader and mathematician, stated that assigning weights tends to be assumption-laden regarding the relationship among the indicators. The literature on robust statistics implies that the best strategy is not an optimized weighting scheme, but is a system to weight each indicator by 1 or 0. If the indicator is good enough to be used, it is weighted equally. If not good, it is excluded entirely. For a stimulating interview with Eckhardt, see Schwager, J., The New Market Wiz- ards, 1995, New York: Harper-Collins, 512 pages, p. 109. An alternate approach is used by Arthur A. Merrill, CMT, who has many decades of experience as both a professional statistician and technical analyst. Mer- rill observes that at any given time some indicators are bullish while others are bear- ish, and it is only human nature to see only those that confirm our preconceived opinion. Merrill’s solution to this problem is to objectively weight the indicators by past performance. First, he measures each indicator by its accuracy in forecasting the direction of the Dow-Jones Industrial Average over 1, 5, 13, 26, and 52 weeks ahead, giving progressively greater weight to the longer time periods, which generally pro- vide the most accurate forecasts. Then, Merrill defines accuracy by the number of correct forecasts divided by the total number of forecasts. He further quantifies 154 Technical Market Indicators accuracy by the chi-squared test of statistical significance with one degree of free- dom. Merrill translates this significance data for all of his indicators into weights pro- portional to the logs of chi-square, which is his own original innovation. Finally, he divides the sum of all bullish weights by the sums of all bullish plus all bearish weights for a totally objective weight of the statistical evidence he calls the Technical Trend Balance.

Commitment of Traders Report Since large commercial hedgers are professionals with the deepest pockets and best insights into supply and demand, they are considered to be the ‘smart money’ in the commodities markets. When the commercials are longer than normal, it is bullish. When they are shorter than normal, it is bearish. Large speculators are also generally correct, although less so. Small speculators, like the public and the odd-lot trader in the stock market, are usually wrong. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission 212 Technical Market Indicators Directional Movement Index (DMI) The Directional Movement Index (DMI) is a unique filtered momentum indicator published by J. Welles Wilder, Jr., in his 1978 book New Concepts in Technical Trad- ing Systems (Trend Research, PO Box 128, McLeansville, NC 27301). DMI is a rather complex trend-following indicator. Wilder has asserted that markets exhibit strong trends only about 30% of the time. To avoid the unprofitable frustration of at- tempting to follow trends in a sideways market, Wilder devised DMI as a filter that permits entry into trades only when markets exhibit significant trending characteris- tics. When a market fails to exhibit significant trending or directional behavior, DMI keeps investors out of the market. By use of exponential moving averages and ratios, DMI tames high, low, and close price data down to a scale that ranges from zero to 100. Directional Movement (DM) is defined as the largest part of the current period’s price range that lies outside the previous period’s price range. Thus, PDM H Hp MDM Lp L where PDM positive or plus DM. MDM negative or minus DM. H the highest price of the current period. Hp the highest price of the previous period. Lp the lowest price of the previous period. L the lowest price of the current period. The lesser of the above two values is reset to equal zero. That is, if PDM MDM, then MDM is reset to equal zero. Or, if MDM PDM, then PDM is reset to equal zero. Also, any negative number is reset to equal zero. Therefore, on an inside day (with lower high and higher low), both PDM and MDM are negative numbers, so both are reset to equal zero. True Range (TR) is defined as the largest value of the following three possibilities: TR H L TR H Cp TR Cp L where Cp is the closing price of the previous period. Before proceeding, the PDM, MDM and TR are smoothed with an exponential smoothing constant. Wilder suggests an exponential smoothing constant of 1/14, or Directional Movement Index (DMI) 213 0.07143, which is roughly equivalent to a 27-day simple moving average. This smoothing is used in all of the following calculations. The Positive Directional Indicator (PDI) is the exponentially Smoothed Plus Di- rectional Movement divided by the exponentially Smoothed True Range. Thus, PDI SPDM/STR Smoothed PDM/Smoothed TR Remember, when Lp L is greater than H Hp, then PDM is reset to zero, so PDI must decline. tially smoothed data: The Minus Directional Indicator (MDI) is defined by the following exponen- MDI SMDM/STR Smoothed MDM/Smoothed TR Remember, when Lp L is less than H Hp, then MDM is reset to zero, so MDI must decline. Next, Directional Movement (DX) is defined as one hundred times the absolute value of the daily difference of PDI minus MDI divided by the sum of PDI plus MDI: DX 100 * | PDI MDI | /(PDI MDI) DX must be always contained in a range from zero (representing equality of PDI and MDI) to 100 (representing all of one and none of the other). Average directional movement (ADX) is a n-period exponential smoothing of DX. (Again, Wilder suggests the same exponential smoothing constant, 1/14 or 0.07143.) Directional Movement Rating (ADXR) is defined as the average of today’s ADX plus the ADX of 14 days ago, that is, the current ADX plus the 14-day-old ADX readings divided by two. Wilder suggests that high and rising levels on ADX and its average, ADXR, in- dicate a healthy and forceful major trend, either up or down. Low and falling levels on ADX and its average, ADXR, indicate a trendless market, going nowhere. As a general guide, ADXR readings less than 20 might indicate a trendless market, while ADXR readings greater than 25 might indicate a market that is trending. Indicator Strategy Example for the Directional Movement Index Historical data shows that Directional Movement can be effective on both the long and short sides, but particularly on the long side. Based on the daily prices for the Dow-Jones Industrial Average for 72 years from 1928 to 2000, we found that the fol- lowing parameters would have produced a significantly positive result on a purely mechanical trend-following signal basis with no subjectivity, no sophisticated techni- cal analysis, and no judgement: 216 Technical Market Indicators Enter Long (Buy) at the current daily price close of the Dow-Jones In- dustrial Average when PDI (2) is greater than MDI (2) and ADX (2) is greater than its own 2-day exponential moving average. Close Long (Sell) at the current daily price close of the Dow-Jones Indus- trial Average when PDI (2) is less than MDI (2) or ADX (2) is less than its own 2-day exponential moving average. Enter Short (Sell Short) at the current daily price close of the Dow-Jones Industrial Average when PDI (2) is less than MDI (2) and ADX (2) is greater than its own 2-day exponential moving average. Close Short (Cover) at the current daily price close of the Dow-Jones In- dustrial Average when PDI (2) is greater than MDI (2) or ADX (2) is less than its own 2-day exponential moving average. Starting with $100 and reinvesting profits, total net profits for this Directional Movement strategy would have been $9,988.57, assuming a fully invested strategy, reinvestment of profits, no transactions costs and no taxes. This is 118.32 percent bet- ter than buy-and-hold. Short selling, which was included in this strategy, would have lost money since October, 1987, but nevertheless would have been profitable over the entire 72-years as a whole. The Equis International MetaStock® System Testing rules are written as follows: Enter long: PDI(opt1) MDI(opt1) AND ADX(opt1) Mov(ADX(opt1),opt1,E) Close long: PDI(opt1) MDI(opt1) OR ADX(opt1) Mov(ADX(opt1),opt1,E) Enter short: PDI(opt1) MDI(opt1) AND ADX(opt1) Mov(ADX(opt1),opt1,E) Close short: PDI(opt1) MDI(opt1) OR ADX(opt1) Mov(ADX(opt1),opt1,E) OPT1 Current value: 2 Low Average Directional Movement (ADX): The Calm Before the Storm Dan Chesler observes a tendency toward marked contraction in volatility and diminu- tion of volume immediately before a breakout of chart pattern boundaries. Chesler uses ADX (with Wilder’s suggested exponential smoothing constant of 1/14 or Divergence Analysis 217 0.07143) as a tool for identifying such junctures. ADX levels below 15 indicate an ab- sence of trend and a conspicuous decrease in volatility—the calm before the storm— which tends to precede trending moves in both bull and bear markets, in both stocks and commodities, and in both daily and intraday charts.

Divergence Analysis Divergence analysis offers the potential for timely signals of impending trend change. But not all divergences are followed by trend change, and response times may be de- layed. In current practice, a wide variety of indexes and indicators are compared against one another to look for technical divergences. Studies suggest that the larger the number of logically selected technical indica- tors that diverge, the more likely a trend reversal. Conversely, the larger the number of indicators that confirm an existing trend, the more likely that trend is to continue. A technical divergence is present when the price of any instrument (stock, in- dex, or contract) makes a significant price movement unconfirmed or unaccompanied by a similar movement in a logically selected companion indicator. For example, when the Dow-Jones Industrial Average makes a new high but the Dow-Jones Transportation Average and the cumulative Daily Advance-Decline Line do not confirm this strength by making new highs, then negative divergences are pre- sent, and these could have bearish implications for the near future. Conversely, if the Industrials make a new low and the Transports and A-D Line do not confirm this weakness by making new lows, then positive divergences are present, and these could have bullish implications for the immediate future. Indeed, in narrow and rigorous chi-squared statistical testing, David A. Glick- stein and Rolf Wubbels (‘Dow Theory is Alive and Well!’, Journal of Portfolio Man- agement, Spring 1983) concluded that daily relationships from 1971 through 1980 between the Dow Jones Industrials and Transports and the cumulative Daily Advance-Decline Line were not random but instead were statistically significant. Independently, Kalish found similar divergences that also were highly statisti- cally significant, beyond the 0.005 level, so the probability is less is than 5 in 1000 that the actual observed outcome was due to random chance alone. This also means, of course, that it is more than 99.5% certain than these relationships did not occur by chance. (See Kalish, Joseph E., ‘Divergence Analysis: Several Empirical Tests,’ Market Technicians Association Journal, May 1986.) Kalish sampled weekly data from 1961 through 1980 to identify divergences between the Dow-Jones Industrial Average, the Dow-Jones Transports, the New York Stock Exchange Cumulative Daily Advance-Decline Line, the 20 Most Active Stocks, the Cumulative Weekly Advance- Envelopes, Moving Average Envelopes, and Trading Bands 257 End Point Moving Average (EPMA) This term is a misnomer, strictly speaking, because the actual indicator is not com- puted like a moving average. Rather, EPMA is the ending value of a Linear Regres- sion trendline plus its slope. (See Time Series Forecast (TSF).) Envelopes, Moving Average Envelopes, and Trading Bands Envelopes are plotted a fixed percentage above and below a moving average. En- velopes are commonly used for overbought and oversold signals: a sell signal is gen- erated when the security reaches the upper band; and a buy signal is generated at the lower band. The length of the moving average and the appropriate percentage plus and minus shift of the moving average both depend on the trading characteristics and the volatility of the security. In general, a greater volatility results in a larger percent- age shift. When overzealous buyers and sellers push prices to extremes, the upper and lower bands provide resistance and support levels for price to reverse trend and revert to the mean (the moving average) or even the opposite extreme. The parameters for Envelopes can vary widely according to a security’s indi- vidual observed historical habits and volatility. For example, Jerry Favors, a well- known market newsletter writer, calculates a 21-day exponential moving average (EMA) for the general stock market indexes, such as the Dow-Jones Industrial Aver- age. For a vertical shift percentage, Jerry favors plus and minus 3.5%. That is, he adds 3.5% to each point on this 21-day EMA to derive the upper envelope. Then he sub- tracts 3.5% from each point on this 21-day EMA to plot the lower envelope. Indicator Strategy Example for Envelopes Even naïve testing assumptions suggest that Envelopes have potential value as a purely mechanical, contra-trend technical indicator. The great majority of oversold buy signals would have been profitable. Moreover, these buy signals would have been robust, with all exponential moving average lengths from 1 to 50 days, minus and plus two percent, profitable and right most of the time, for long trades only. As attractive as a high percentage of profitable trades may seem, however, it is important to note that this (like other contra-trend strategies) failed to provide any protection in the Crash of ’87, the decline of 1998 and other market price drops. As the chart shows, there are sharp equity drawdowns. Using Envelopes for contra-trend oversold and overbought signals slightly outperformed the passive buy-and-hold strategy for long trades only, while short selling would not have been profitable in the past. 260 Technical Market Indicators Based on a 18-year file of daily data for the entire history of the S&P 500 Com- posite Stock Price Index futures contract from 4/21/82 to 12/08/00 collected from www.csidata.com, we found that the following parameters would have produced a positive result on a purely mechanical overbought/oversold signal basis with no sub- jectivity, no sophisticated technical analysis, and no judgement: Enter Long (Buy) at the current daily price close when the S&P 500 Composite Stock Price Index futures contract closing price is less than yesterday’s 4-day exponential moving average of the daily closing prices minus 2%. Close Long (Sell) at the current daily price close when the S&P 500 Com- posite Stock Price Index futures contract closing price is greater than yesterday’s 4-day exponential moving average of the daily closing prices plus 2%. Enter Short (Sell Short) never. Starting with $100 and reinvesting profits, total net profits for this Envelopes counter-trend strategy would have been $1,080.61, assuming a fully invested strategy, reinvestment of profits, no transactions costs and no taxes. This would have been 3.35 percent greater than buy-and-hold. No short selling would have been profitable, and no short selling was included in the strategy. Short selling would have cut the profit to less than buy-and-hold. Long-only Envelopes as an indicator would have given profitable buy signals 84.09% of the time. Trading would have been only moderately active at one trade every 35.26 calendar days. Note that this strategy considers clos- ing prices only while ignoring intraday highs and lows. The Equis International MetaStock® System Testing rules for Envelopes are written as follows: Enter long: CLOSE (Ref(Mov(CLOSE,opt1,E),-1)- ((opt2/1000))*Ref(Mov(CLOSE,opt1,E),-1)) Close long: CLOSE (Ref(Mov(CLOSE,opt1,E),-1) ((opt2/1000))*Ref(Mov(CLOSE,opt1,E),-1)) OPT1 Current value: 4 OPT2 Current value: 20 Equity Drop Ratio The Equity Drop Ratio, a measure of risk, is the annualized return divided by the standard deviation of the equity drops of the Cumulative Equity Line. Exponential Moving Average (EMA). Exponential Smoothing 261 Exploratory Data Analysis Exploratory Data Analysis is the process of identifying systematic relations between variables when there are no (or not complete) a priori expectations as to the nature of those relations. In a typical exploratory data analysis process, many variables are taken into account and compared, using a variety of techniques, in a search for sys- tematic patterns. We require variables found to be related to pass tests of logic and common sense before we proceed to the next step in model building. Exponential Moving Average (EMA), Exponential Smoothing The Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is also referred to as Exponential Smooth- ing. The EMA is the best of the moving average techniques, and it is increasingly pre- ferred by technical analysts over other moving average methods. Behaviorally, in its responsiveness to new data being generated by the markets, the EMA represents an excellent compromise between the overly sensitive weighted moving average and the overly sluggish simple moving average. Compared to other averaging techniques, the EMA follows the trend of the current data smoothly and seamlessly, minimizing jumps, wiggles, and lags. Computationally, the EMA is the simplest and most streamlined of all moving average techniques. The EMA requires the fewest calculations, the least data han- dling, and the least data history. The EMA requires numerical values for only two data periods: the most recently available raw data and the immediate past period’s EMA. For example, working with daily data, we need only today’s observed, unprocessed data and yesterday’s EMA in order to calculate today’s EMA. Thus, the EMA elimi- nates the need to keep and handle long lists of historical data. A significant advantage of this superior computational method is that the EMA is never distorted by old data suddenly dropping out of the calculation. Old data is never suddenly dropped because it is not actually part of the calculation. For practi- cal purposes, the effect of past data fades away gradually due to the ever decreasing weighting of yesterday’s EMA. The EMA’s method of calculation correctly avoids the problem of erratic current movement caused solely by irrelevant and obsolete data dropping out of the calculation. 262 Technical Market Indicators An Exponential Moving Average is calculated as follows: EMA (C Ep)K Ep where EMA the Exponential Moving Average for the current period. C the closing price for the current period. Ep the Exponential Moving Average for the previous period. K the exponential smoothing constant, equal to 2/(n 1). n the total number of periods in a simple moving average to be roughly approximated by the EMA. The exponential smoothing constant formula, K 2/(n 1), allows an approx- imate comparison of any EMA to the more sluggish Simple Moving Average of length n. As the number of days n increases, the value of K grows ever smaller, and the EMA becomes increasingly less sensitive to the newer data. Use this table to quickly convert from simple n days to exponential smoothing constants (K), and back. n days K 2/(n 1) n days K 2/(n 1) n days K 2/(n 1) n days K 2/(n 1) 1 1.00000 10 0.18182 100 0.01980 1000 0.00200 2 0.66667 20 0.09524 200 0.00995 2000 0.00100 3 0.50000 30 0.06452 300 0.00664 3000 0.00067 4 0.40000 40 0.04878 400 0.00499 4000 0.00050 5 0.33333 50 0.03922 500 0.00399 5000 0.00040 6 0.28571 60 0.03279 600 0.00333 6000 0.00033 7 0.25000 70 0.02817 700 0.00285 7000 0.00029 8 0.22222 80 0.02469 800 0.00250 8000 0.00025 9 0.20000 90 0.02198 900 0.00222 9000 0.00022 10 0.18182 100 0.01980 1000 0.00200 10000 0.00020 When first starting a new EMA, it takes approximately n days of calculations for an accurate reading. For a quick startup of a EMA, on the first day of calculation we may use a n day simple moving average to approximate the previous day’s EMA (Ep) in the formula, EMA (C Ep)K Ep After that first day, we will never need any data other than yesterday’s EMA and today’s fresh data to maintain our EMA. The table on the facing page illustrates how to compute an EMA of four peri- ods, which is also known as a 40% EMA, named for the exponential smoothing con- stant, K. 264 Technical Market Indicators Indicator Strategy Example for the Exponential Moving Average (EMA), 120-days Based on the daily closing prices for the DJIA from 1900 to 2001, Exponential Mov- ing Average Crossover Strategies of all lengths from 1 day to 300 days would have been profitable and would have beaten the passive buy-and-hold-strategy by at least 69%. The 5-, 3- and 2-day EMA would have produced maximum net profits in excess of six billion dollars, assuming we start with one hundred dollars in 1900. All EMA period lengths of 1 to 20 days would have produced net profits in excess of ten mil- lion dollars, and all 20 lengths would have outperformed buy-and-hold by more than 540 to one. All EMA period lengths of 1 to 60 days would have produced net profits in excess of one million dollars, and all 60 lengths would have outperformed buy- and-hold by more than 64 to one. Of the ‘intermediate-term’ lengths, the 44-day EMA would have produced the best results, net profit of $3,251,721, which would have been more than 162 times the buy-and-hold-strategy’s $20,105. Performance de- teriorated as the moving average period length increased. The popular 200-day EMA Crossover Strategy would have produced much less profit of $109,158, which would have been only 5.4 times the buy-and-hold-strategy’s $20,105 net profit. Of the ‘long-term’ EMA period lengths in excess of 100 days, the 120-day EMA Crossover Strategy would have produced the maximum profit on a purely me- chanical trend-following signal basis with no subjectivity, no sophisticated technical analysis, and no judgement: Enter Long (Buy) at the current daily price close of the DJIA when this close is greater than the previous day’s 120-day exponential moving aver- age of the daily closing prices. Close Long (Sell) at the current daily price close of the DJIA when this close is less than the previous day’s 120-day exponential moving average of the daily closing prices. Enter Short (Sell Short) at the current daily price close of the DJIA when this close is less than the previous day’s 120-day exponential moving av- erage of the daily closing prices. Close Short (Cover) at the current daily price close of the DJIA when this close is greater than the previous day’s 120-day exponential moving aver- age of the daily closing prices. Exponential Moving Average (EMA). Exponential Smoothing 265 Starting with $100 and reinvesting profits, total net profits for this 120-day EMA Crossover Strategy would have been $508,772.91, assuming a fully invested strategy, reinvestment of profits, no transactions costs and no taxes. This would have been 2,430.53 percent better than buy-and-hold. Short selling would have been prof- itable, but not since the Crash of ’87. Trading frequency would have been moderate with one trade every 33.57 calendar days. There would have been 240 profitable trades and 862 losing trades, for a winning percentage of only 21.78% profitable. But because this trend-following strategy cuts losses and lets profits run, it makes money despite being wrong on most of its signals. This is typical of the longer-term trend- following strategies. Such a strategy may be used alone, and it also can be useful as a filter to other trading systems. The Equis International MetaStock® System Testing rules are written as follows: Enter long: CLOSE Ref(Mov(CLOSE,opt1,E),-1) Close long: CLOSE Ref(Mov(CLOSE,opt1,E),-1) Enter short: CLOSE Ref(Mov(CLOSE,opt1,E),-1) Close short: CLOSE Ref(Mov(CLOSE,opt1,E),-1) OPT1 Current value: 120 Indicator Strategy Example for the Exponential Moving Average (EMA), 5-days This is the best simple trend-following indicator we tested against daily DJIA data. Substituting 5-days for 120-days in the same formula (above), and starting with $100 and reinvesting profits, total net profits for this 5-day EMA Crossover Strategy would have been $16 billion, assuming a fully invested strategy, reinvestment of profits, no transactions costs and no taxes. This would have been 78 million percent better than buy-and-hold. Short selling would have been profitable. Trading frequency would have been hyperactive with one trade every 5.88 calendar days. There would have been 2417 profitable trades and 3889 losing trades, for a winning percentage of only 38.33% profitable. Hypothesis Testing 305 Our tests suggest another one: ‘Sell Labor Day, buy Halloween.’ More specifi- cally, ‘Sell on September 5th, buy on October 27th.’ This one has a quite a good record (see Months of the Year). Holy Grail Holy Grail is a particular price setup: within a strong price uptrend making new highs, and after a minor price pullback to the 20-day exponential moving average, buy when the price moves above the previous day’s high. A strong price uptrend is defined by a Average Directional Movement (14) above 30 and rising. Place a protective stop just below the recent pullback low and trail the stop upward. Look to book profits at the recent swing high. For further details on this setup, see Connors, Laurence A., and Raschke, Linda Bradford, Street Smarts, High Probability Short-Term Trading Strate- gies, M. Gordon Publishing Group, Malibu, California, 1995, 239 pages. Hook A Hook occurs when price breaks out above or below a resistance or support level but immediately reverses with a forceful move in the opposite direction. This hooks or traps trend-followers who went with the breakout. These trend-followers must now cut losses, which adds fuel to the new directional momentum. The resulting fast move is of interest to short-term traders. A Hook is also known as a Springboard. Hypothesis Testing Traditional hypothesis testing is designed to verify a priori hypotheses about relations between variables. In the world of academic finance, controlled laboratory experiments are not pos- sible; historical data may be subject to errors and biases or not be available in suffi- cient quantities; computer testing programs may be vulnerable to certain hidden assumptions, bugs and biases; mathematical theories and formulas may be dependent on unrealistic assumptions; and assumptions must be made about difficult-to-quantify variables such as transactions costs. Contrast that to the gradual evolution of classic technical analysis, which has been tested with no assumptions, in real time, every day, in all kinds of market con- ditions, over many decades, by many thousands of traders, and with real money. Technical analysis has been hammered out on the hard anvil of harsh market reality every day that traders do their jobs, buying and selling. 306 Technical Market Indicators Indicator Seasons, Elder’s Concept There is a time to sow and a time to reap. Indicator Seasons can show a trader where he is in the market cycle, according to Alexander Elder (Trading for a Living: Psy- chology, Trading Tactics, Money Management, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, 1993). Elder’s idea of Indicator Seasons is based on Gerald Appel’s Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator. (See Moving Average Convergence Divergence.) To signal trades, Elder uses the position relative to the zero line (above or be- low) and the slope (rising or falling) of the Moving Average Convergence Divergence Histogram (MACDH). Slope is defined as the relationship between the current MACDH and the previous period’s MACDH. When the weekly MACDH is below zero and its slope turns positive, it is springtime in the market and time to buy. Hold a long position until the weekly MACDH moves above zero–it is now summer and time to start selling. When the weekly MACDH is above zero and its slope turns negative, it is fall in the market and time to sell short. Hold a short position until the weekly MACDH moves below zero–it is now winter and time to start covering shorts. Indicator Seasons, Colby’s Variation Elder’s original concept, as outlined on pages 188–192 of his book, did not perform well in our independent tests. But we found a variation using daily data and modified rules for interpretation that would have substantially outperformed the market, with- out any optimization. When the daily MACDH is above zero and its slope is positive, it is springtime in the market and time to buy. Hold a long position as long as the daily MACDH re- mains above zero and its slope is positive. Liquidate longs when either the daily MACDH crosses under zero or its slope turns downward. When the daily MACDH is below zero and its slope is negative, it is time for the market to fall. Therefore, it is time to sell short. Hold a short position as long as the daily MACDH remains below zero and its slope is negative. Liquidate shorts when either the daily MACDH crosses above zero or its slope turns upward. Indicator Strategy Example for Indicator Seasons, Colby’s Variation After the 1930’s, the cumulative equity line for Indicator Seasons, Colby’s Variation, shows few drawdown periods. Based on a 101-year file, from January 1900 to April 2001, of the MACDH at the end of each day and the DJIA daily closing price, the fol- lowing parameters would have produced a positive result on a purely mechanical sig- nal basis with no subjectivity, no sophisticated technical analysis, and no judgement: Indicator Seasons, Elder’s Concept 307 Enter Long (Buy) at the current daily price close of the DJIA when cur- rent MACDH is both greater than zero and above its previous day’s level, thus showing positive and rising price velocity. Close Long (Sell) at the current daily price close of the DJIA when current MACDH is either less than zero or below its previous day’s level, thus showing deteriorating price velocity. Enter Short (Sell Short) at the current daily price close of the DJIA when current MACDH is both less than zero and below its previous day’s level, thus showing negative and worsening price velocity. Close Short (Cover) at the current daily price close of the DJIA when cur- rent MACDH is either greater than zero or above its previous day’s level, thus showing positively changing price velocity. Starting with $100 and reinvesting profits, total net profits for this Indicator Sea- sons, Colby’s Variation, trend-following strategy would have been $3,631,710.75, as- suming a fully invested strategy, reinvestment of profits, no transactions costs and no taxes. This would have been 17,919.98 percent greater than buy-and-hold. Short sell- ing would have been profitable, and short selling was included in the strategy. Despite its high profitability, the strategy would have been wrong more often than it was right, with only 45.07% winning trades.

Rather than using the default settings of 12, 26, and 9 for MACDH, we can allow these to vary. Re- markably, profitability increases nearly five fold when we plug in 3, 33, and 3 in place of the default 12, 26, and 9 for MACDH. Starting with $100 and reinvesting profits, total net profits for this Indicator Seasons, Colby’s Variation–Optimized, trend-following strategy would have been $1,682,521,344, assuming a fully invested strategy, reinvestment of profits, no trans- actions costs and no taxes. This would have been 8,348,307.47 percent greater than buy-and-hold. Short selling would have been profitable, and short selling was in- cluded in the strategy. Despite its high profitability, the strategy would have been wrong more often than it was right, with only 47.42% winning trades. Trading would have been even more hyperactive at one trade every 4.27 calendar days.

This idea has long been attractive to market technicians, some of whom are also highly trained in the physical sciences. The Inertia indicator was developed by Donald G. Dorsey and first introduced in the September 1995 issue of Technical Analysis of Stocks & Commodities maga- zine (www.traders.com). Dorsey’s Inertia indicator is simply a smoothed version of his Relative Volatility Index (see Relative Volatility Index). Dorsey reasoned that it takes significantly more energy for a market to reverse direction than to continue along the same path. He used price momentum to quantify the direction of price motion and volatility as a measurement of inertia. Dorsey de- fined Inertia as a smoothed Relative Volatility Index (RVI). His preferred smoothing mechanism is Linear Regression (see Linear Regression). The RVI measures the gen- eral direction of volatility. If the Inertia indicator is above 50, positive inertia is indicated. The long-term trend is up and should remain up as long as the indicator is above 50. If Inertia is below 50, negative inertia is indicated. The long-term trend is down and should remain down as long as the indicator is below 50. Our Indicator Strategy testing for Dorsey’s Inertia indicator confirms that Iner- tia indeed lives up to its name—it is inert. By smoothing the RVI, Inertia filters out even more signals than RVI. In fact, it eliminates nearly all signals. Meanwhile it pro- duces a level of profitability not significantly better than the passive buy-and-hold strategy. (See Relative Volatility Index (RVI)). Insiders’ Sell/Buy Ratio An insider is an officer, director, or beneficial owner of a company’s stock. Insiders of companies with publicly traded securities are required to report any changes in di- rect or indirect holdings to the Securities and Exchange Commission no later than the tenth day of the month following the month of the transaction. In an effort to prevent insiders from taking advantage of access to materially significant information before it is made available to the public, insiders are legally prohibited from realizing a profit from their transactions within at least six months. If an insider should realize a profit within six months, any shareholder may challenge the publicly reported transaction, and the insider could be required to return any such short-term gains to the company. Insiders are in a position to acquire superior information and insight into the prospects for their companies. Therefore, it is logical that they would buy when their Insiders’ Sell/Buy Ratio 315 company’s fortunes are about to improve, or when the stock price has fallen irre- sistibly far below its intrinsic value. People buy a stock when they have positive ex- pectations about the stock’s future performance. Logically, Insiders ought to be motivated to sell their stock when the company’s future prospects are likely to deteriorate, or when the stock price has risen too far above its intrinsic value. It is said that insiders sometimes sell stocks in order to diversify, to raise funds for personal and family expenditures, for philanthropy, for estate planning and for other reasons not necessarily related to a stock’s investments merits. As a result in- siders’ future expectations for their company’s stock may be not always completely obvious judging by their stock sales. Vickers’ weekly Insider Sell/Buy Ratio rates each company’s insider transac- tions for the past six months, taking into account the following, weighted by relative importance: 1. 2. 3. 4. The number of insider buy and sell transactions for each company. The percentage change in an insider’s holdings with each purchase or sale. Unanimity among a given company’s insiders, either all buys or all sells. Reversals in insiders buying patterns, either a change from buying to selling, or a change from selling to buying. 5. Transactions involving $250,000 or more dollar value are given added weight. Vickers publishes its weekly Insider Sell/Buy Ratio and an 8-week moving av- erage of the ratio. Vickers considers a ratio of 2.25 neutral, under 2.25 suggests a ris- ing market, and greater than 2.25 suggests heavy insider selling and a weakening market. The average Insider Sell/Buy Ratio is 1.99 over the past quarter century. The original source of data on insider trading is Vickers Stock Re- search Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Argus Research Group, www.argusgroup.com. Vickers provides updates on transactions and holdings of corporate officials, significant shareholders and institutions. Vickers’ data are avail- able electronically, via hard copy, and on magnetic tape. Indicator Strategy Example for the weekly Insiders’ Sell/Buy Ratio The data shows that the Insiders’ Sell/Buy Ratio can be an effective indicator, but on the long side only. Short selling would not have been profitable. Based on the weekly Insiders’ Sell/Buy Ratio and the DJIA for nearly 30 years from April 1971 to January 2001, we found that the following parameters would have produced a significantly positive result on a purely mechanical trend-following signal basis with no subjectiv- ity, no sophisticated technical analysis, and no judgement: Insiders’ Sell/Buy Ratio 319 Enter Long (Buy) at the current weekly price close of the DJIA when the 5-week Simple Moving Average of the Insiders’ Sell/Buy Ratio is less than 2.25, thus indicating relatively low Insiders’ Selling. Close Long (Sell) at the current weekly price close of the DJIA when the 5-week Simple Moving Average of the Insiders’ Sell/Buy Ratio is greater than 2.25, thus indicating relatively high Insiders’ Selling. Enter Short (Sell Short) never. Starting with $100 and reinvesting profits, total net profits for this Insiders’ Sell/Buy Ratio contrary strategy would have been $1324.14, assuming a fully in- vested strategy, reinvestment of profits, no transactions costs and no taxes. This would have been 29.22 percent better than buy-and-hold. Short selling would have been unprofitable and was not included in this strategy. The long-only Insiders’ Sell/Buy Ratio would have given profitable signals 76.74% of the time. Trading would have been inactive at one trade every 252.84 calendar days. The Equis International MetaStock® System Testing rules, where the Insiders’ Sell/Buy Ratio is inserted into the field normally reserved for volume, are written as follows: Enter long: Mov(V,opt1,S) < opt2 Close long: Mov(V,opt1,S) > opt2 OPT1 Current value: 5 OPT2 Current value: 225 An Independent Indicator Strategy Example: Corporate Insiders’ Big Block Transactions The following is an abbreviated summary of a paper, ‘Corporate Insiders’ Big Block Transactions’, written in 1999 by Eric Bjorgen and Steve Leuthold of the Leuthold Group. The paper won the annual Charles H. Dow Award for market analysis. Unusually low insider selling is bullish and unusually high insider selling is bearish. Insiders normally are net sellers on balance, in increasing amounts over time. To normalize the data for their analysis, the authors used a 10-week average dollar amount of net insider selling as a percentage of total market capitalization. From 1983 into 1999, a period of 16.3 years, the normalized 10-week average dollar amount of net insider selling spent 85.6% of its time within a normal range from 0.01% to 0.07% of total market capitalization. This means that the normalized average spent 14.4% of its time outside that normal range. Of that outside normal range-time (100.0%), insiders spent more time engaging in unusually high selling (60.4%) than engaging in unusually low selling (39.6%). In other words, the normal- ized average spent 1.4 years or 74 weeks or 8.7% of the total time of 16.3 years in the 320 Technical Market Indicators high selling zone. The normalized average spent 0.9 years or 48 weeks or 5.7% of the total time of 16.3 years in the low selling zone. From 1983 to late 1990, the normalized average showed net buying on only three occasions, and each time a bear market bottom occurred within weeks. When insider net selling has been unusually low, the S&P 500 has outperformed its average performance by several percentage points going forward 3, 6, 9 and 12 months ahead. Low selling identified the market bottoms of 1984, 1987 and 1990 within several weeks. But there was not a single instance of an unusually low level of insider selling from late 1990 to the time of the paper in 1999. Insider’s Net Selling Levels S&P 500 Average Return 3 Months 6 Months 9 Months 12 Months High 0.6% 3.5% 7.0% 0.3% Normal 3.7% 7.2% 10.7% 14.8% Low 6.0% 10.4% 13.5% 17.7% The ‘Insider’s Net Selling Levels’ table shows that when insider selling has been ‘High,’ the S&P 500 underperformed ‘Normal’ substantially, especially 12 months ahead. A rapid increase in insider net selling often preceded or coincided with market weakness and price volatility. However, the signals were 6 to 12 months early. For example, insider net selling peaked in March 1987, but the market did not crash until 7 months later in October 1987. Also, the insider selling spike in the fall of 1989 was immediately followed by a choppy market, but the S&P 500 did not collapse un- til August 1990. The table also shows that when insider selling has been ‘Low,’ the S&P 500 has outperformed ‘Normal’ by 2.3 to 3.2 percentage points. Big Block transactions were defined as those involving more than 100,000 shares or a total transaction value greater than $1,000,000. Corporate insiders increased selling following the SEC’s 1997 code revision shortening the holding period of restricted shares. Also in 1997, there was a long-term maximum capital gains tax rate cut to 20%. Both of these changes have encouraged increasing selling by insiders. Normalizing the data by adjusting for the growth of the stock market over time allows a better historical perspective. This also shows net insider selling increasing since 1991. Insider trading laws prohibit using ‘material, non-public information’ for fi- nancial gain. Still, insiders’ insights into the probable success or failure of future cor- porate plans naturally influence insiders decisions about when and whether to buy or sell company stock. Consequently, insider transactions reflect insights that might not Intermarket Divergences 321 be available in cautiously worded company news releases. Since the stock market is the sum of all public firms, it follows that the aggregate buying and selling patterns of all insiders could offer insights into future prospects of the stock market. The SEC makes information on insider’s transactions available weekly. By law, all corporate insiders (and beneficial owners who hold 10% or more of outstanding shares) are required to file Form 4 by the tenth day of the month following a transac- tion. Each week the latest filings are compiled and published in Vicker’s Weekly In- sider. The transactions of corporations, foundations, trusts and other institutional shareholders are ignored, since these transactions are often motivated by factors that have nothing to do with the financial prospects of a company. Insiders buy and sell transactions are summed for a weekly aggregate net dollar amount of selling and buying. Most of the time, selling is much greater than buying. Weeks of net selling outnumber weeks of net buying 12 to 1. Insiders’ sell transac- tions include the sale of stock resulting from the exercise of options, although no cor- responding buy transaction occurs when options are issued. In the seven years from 1992 to 1999, the sell/buy ratio climbed to 50 to 1, partly due to increasing use of op- tions to compensate corporate insiders. As option issuance and market capitalization increased, net selling has drifted upward, so the data must be normalized by dividing by total market capitalization. While the dollar amount measures the magnitude of insider’s transactions, the net number of transactions measures the breadth of net sells/buys. Normally the two data series move together. Occasionally, the weekly net dollar amount of net selling surges, but the net number of sell transactions remains flat. This indicates that there were one or more unusually large transactions during that particular week, for exam- ple, huge blocks of Texaco in July 1989, Duracell in May 1995, and Microsoft in March 1998. When insider data shows both record dollar amounts and record num- bers of net sell transactions, a market peak follows. In 1983, 1987, 1993 and late 1989, selling surges foreshadowed significant price drops. Three later selling surges in the 1990s were followed by market price consolidation. A set of sell signals oc- curred during Q2 of 1998, offering a timely warning of the market price decline dur- ing Q3 of 1998. Intermarket Divergences The trader first identifies two (or more) closely equivalent financial instruments that trade separately. When two prices diverge, by one not moving to a proportionately similar extent or in a similar direction as the other, the trader initiates a trade. He may buy one and short the other in an attempt to take advantage of possible price move- ment if the two instruments come back into alignment, as they usually do. 322 Technical Market Indicators The risk is that on occasion there is a good reason for the divergence and the misalignment persists or even intensifies. This happened in a dramatic way to Long Term Capital Management, which quickly lost so many billions of dollars betting on normality that it required a massive government-sponsored financial bailout in 1998. Intraday Trading, Day Trading, Behavior of Prices Through the Day Arthur A. Merrill, CMT, pioneered the study of seasonal behavior of stock market prices in his classic book, Behavior of Prices on Wall Street, Second Edition, The Analysis Press, Chappaqua, New York, 1984, 147 pages. On pages 10-11, he revealed the ‘Behavior Through the Day,’ based on a tally of hourly price changes from Janu- ary 1962 through December 1974. It may be significant to note that during this period the Dow-Jones Industrial Average fell from 731.14 to 616.24, a decline of 18.65%. Merrill found that the hour-by-hour pattern today depends on the trend yester- day. If the DJIA rose yesterday, then the market opened higher 70% of the time. Next, during the first hour of trading, 62% of the time the market continued to move higher. After that bullish first full hour of trading, during the middle of the day, 53% to 55% of the time there was profit taking and downward price movement. During the next to last hour of trading, 53% of the time there was upside price movement. Finally, dur- ing the last hour of trading, 54% of the time there was downward price movement, presumably as day traders closed out long positions. The daily pattern was much different following a down day. Merrill found that if the DJIA fell the previous day, then the next day the market opened lower 65% of the time. After the open, there was a slight tendency for the market to continue to de- cline, on average, although that depended on the particular day of the week. On Mon- days, there was a definite tendency for the market to continue to move lower through the close. But this clear bearish bias was less pronounced on Wednesdays and Thurs- days. In contrast, on Tuesdays there was no bearish tendency after the open, and on Fridays, the market was slightly (but not significantly) more likely to rise after the open and through the rest of the day. The performance of the DJIA at half-hour intervals is updated each year in Yale Hirsch’s, Stock Traders Almanac, The Hirsch Organization, Inc., 184 Central Avenue, Old Tappan, NJ 07675, pages 128-129, www.stocktradersalmanac.com.

Intraday Trading, Day Trading, Behavior of Prices Through the Day 325 Hirsch recently published a study of half-hourly price changes from January 1987 through December 1999. It may be significant to note that during this period the DJIA rose from 1895.95 to 11497.12, a remarkable increase of 506.40%. Based on this bullish bias, we reasonably might expect to find significantly bullish tendencies, but such was hardly the case. The most consistent tendency was to rise late in the day, particularly the last half hour from 3:30 to the close at 4 PM, but even that occurred only 55% of the time. Also, the half hour from 2:30 to 3 PM was bullish every day of the week, on average, but only 53% of the time. On balance, the last 1.5 hours from 2:30 to the close at 4 PM were up a bit more than half of the time. The open tended to be higher about 54% of the time, every day but Monday, when it was down 54% of the time. There was a decline from 10 to 10:30 AM, about 53% of the time. The rest of the day the market action was remarkable only for its complete statistical insignificance. Tendencies evident a little more or less than half the time are hardly better than flipping a coin and far from enough to inspire confidence in trading. Moreover, intra- day tendencies are easily overwhelmed by news reports and rumors that surface at unpredictable times during the day. ‘Day traders die broke,’ is an old saying on Wall Street. An August 1999, study by the North American Securities Administration Association (NASAA) found that 70% of the customers at a day-trading firm surveyed lost money. Only 11.5% of the traders in the sampling showed they had the ability to conduct profitable short-term trading, even during a record-breaking bull market trend. Day traders exchange limited risk for limited reward. At the end of the month, a long list of small gains and small losses have to offset commissions, slippage, fees, and taxes and other expenses that the trader must pay. Trading is a highly competitive business with many thousands of competitors fighting hard with each other trying to win small fractions of a dollar. The advantage lies with the house and the market mak- ers. But even their jobs are far from easy, and they have been known to lose large sums in difficult market environments. It has long been said that the typical investor is much more likely to profit from major price trends that last for months or even years, as opposed to the relatively in- significant price ripples that occur within a typical trading day. Even short-term traders can benefit from stepping back from the confusion of daily fluctuations to see the bigger picture, the major trends beyond the reach of day-to-day random noise. The value of a major trend perspective has long been recognized by astute tech- nical analysts. Nearly seven decades ago, Richard W. Schabacker emphasized that short-term traders are likely to be more successful when they trade in harmony with the direction of the major trend, rather than trying to capture every minor move. The technical trader ‘will seldom if ever lose very much by holding himself aloof from 326 Technical Market Indicators constant communication with the ticker and, indeed, he is much more likely to bene- fit by divorcing himself from the excitement, the conversation, the gossip, the im- petuosities, and the nerve strain, which emanate from watching the erratic fluctuations within the day’s market from the dubious vantage point of the board- room. Many professional operators are past masters in the art of so splitting or bunch- ing their orders in order to make the tape produce the effect they desire at a certain time of the day on the crowds who are watching in the board-room. The ideal aim of the chart student is to let the action of the market speak for itself in forecasting its own technical position, and it is exceedingly difficult to assume the calm open- mindedness necessary for such an ideal, while exposed to the psychological tides of board-room gossip, news, hopes and fears.’—Schabacker, Richard W., Technical Analysis and Stock Market Profits, A Course in Forecasting, Pitman Publishing, 128 Long Acre, London WC2C9AN, 1932 and 1997, 451 pages, page 372. January Barometer 327 January Barometer As January goes, so goes the year. The January Barometer historical performance sta- tistics are updated each year in Yale Hirsch’s, Stock Traders Almanac, The Hirsch Organization, Inc., 184 Central Avenue, Old Tappan, NJ 07675, www.stocktrader- salmanac.com. His statistical table is reprinted here with permission. Hirsch’s Al- manac provides annual updates on the January Barometer and a variety of other interesting calendar-based statistical studies. The January Barometer is simply the up or down direction of the S&P 500 Com- posite Stock Price Index in the month of January, from the closing price level of the last trading day of December to the last trading day of January just one month later. From 1950 through 2000, the January Barometer has correctly predicted all of the 25 S&P moves in excess of 14% for the full-year. For all 51 years, this simple January direction has effectively predicted the full- year direction of stock market prices 82% of the time: it has been right 42 times out of the past 51 years. Years beginning with January gains were followed by up full years 31 out of 33 times, or 94% of the time. In 1994, the indicator missed by only 1.5%. The only other loss was in 1966, when a January gain was followed by a full-year decline of 13.1%, which was not a major market loss. In general, the larger the gain in January, the larger the gain for the full year. The indicator is not quite as accurate on its bearish forecasts. Following 18 Jan- uary losses, the full year was down 11 times, or 61% of the time. The unusually per- sistent and powerful bull market that started in 1982 overwhelmed this indicator to some extent, accounting for three of the wrong bearish forecasts that were followed by price gains by year end. Following its small error in 1994, the January Barometer has been back on track, 100% correct, for the most recent six years. Oddly, over the past 51 years, the January Barometer has never missed in odd- numbered years, such as 2001. So, for years ending in an odd number, it has a perfect record. Of course, perfect records always have a special allure. Everyone would like to be right all of the time. But if we choose to live in reality, we must ask ourselves if the January Barometer might be just some statistical quirk, a mere historical coincidence. Thoughtful analysts are troubled by the absence of any compelling and logical ratio- nale behind this indicator. A prudent analyst might look to other indicators for confirmation. In fact, that is a good idea when using any one indicator, no matter how logical and accurate it may seem. Times change and markets change. Few indicators, no matter how impressive, can be expected to sustain overwhelming accuracy through the years. Long experi- ence with markets clearly shows that the search for perfection will no doubt remain elusive and in all probability counter productive. 328 Technical Market Indicators Reprinted with permission of Yale Hirsch, Stock Traders Almanac, The Hirsch Organization, Inc., 184 Central Avenue, Old Tappan, NJ 07675, www.stocktradersalmanac.com.

January Effect The January Effect is the tendency of small, cheap stocks beaten down by year-end tax-loss selling to make bottoms around the third week of December. After that, these stocks tend to rebound strongly for a month or so, until the third week of January. Data published by Yale Hirsch suggests that this happens most years. Hirsch’s obser- vations are reprinted here with permission.

January’s First Five Days Early Warning Sys- tem’s historical performance statistics are updated each year in Yale Hirsch’s, Stock Traders Almanac, The Hirsch Organization, Inc., 184 Central Avenue, Old Tappan, NJ 07675, www.stocktradersalmanac.com. His statistical table is reprinted here with permission. Hirsch’s Almanac provides annual updates on a variety of interesting cal- endar-based statistical studies. If the S&P 500 Composite Stock Price Index goes up during the first five trad- ing days of the year, the market for the whole year tends to go up. Since 1950, this bullish Early Warning has worked 27 out of 31 times, or 87% of the time. Yale Hirsch suggests that three of the four misses might have been thrown off by war news–Viet- nam in 1966 and 1973, and Iraq-Kuwait in 1990. Indeed, history strongly suggests that war often coincides with jittery, unpredictable stock market movements. The op- posite side of the early January coin has not been accurate since 1950; that is, bearish signals have not been significant. But before the unusual bull market that started in 1982, when the S&P 500 Composite Stock Price Index fell during the first five trad- ing days of the year, the market for the whole year went down 73% of the time. Alas, the powerful bullish trend since 1982 reduced that tendency to less-than coin-flip ac- curacy.

It is similar to the western Point-and-Figure technique in that price movement (and not the passage of time) determines the progress along the hor- izontal x-axis. For trend continuation, a Kagi line is extended in the prevailing trend direction whenever the current closing price continues to progress in the same direction as the latest vertical Kagi line, no matter how small the price movement. For a trend reversal, a new Kagi line heading in the opposite direction is drawn in a new column to the right only when the closing price reverses direction by a fixed and predetermined amount, called a reversal amount. This reversal amount is usually expressed in a some obvious unit of local currency, such as one dollar, though it could be set to any amount. Alternately, the reversal amount could be defined as a percent- age price change. But when the closing price moves in the opposite direction by less than the reversal amount, no new lines are drawn on the Kagi Chart. When the current closing price moves beyond the previous column’s high or low, the thickness of the Kagi line changes. Specifically, when a thin Kagi line pene- trates (rises above) the previous high point on the Kagi chart, the line becomes thick. In contrast, when a thick Kagi line violates (falls below) a previous low point on the Kagi chart, the line becomes thin. The chart shows the one dollar reversal amount Kagi Chart for the S&P De- positary Receipts (SPY) for the full year 2000, January through December, drawn with MetaStock® software. See Renko Chart to compare this Kagi Chart to the simi- lar 1 point box size Renko Chart and to the 1 point box size and 1 point reversal Point-and-Figure Chart for the same stock over the same time.

Linear Regression Line Linear regression is a mathematical method for quantifying a straight-line relation- ship between one independent and one dependent variable, or any two variables. It is commonly used with price and time data to identify trends. Mathematically the linear regression formula is represented as: y a bx where y the closing price. x the position of the current time period in the database. a 1/n ( y - b x). b (n xy- x y)/n x2 - ( x)2 n number of time periods in the summations. Summation symbol, sum over n periods. Linear Regression uses the least squares method to fit a trendline to the data. It arrives at the best fit by minimizing the distance between the given data points and the fitted Linear Regression trendline. MetaStock® software (www.equis.com) predefines the formula for the Linear Regression trendline on its indicator menu. The software plots any n-day Linear Re- gression Line at the end date of the calculation. Thus, the current n-day Linear Re- gression Line is plotted at today’s date. For all practical purposes, this Linear Regression Line changes every day, trailing and tracking the current price, much like a trailing moving average. Therefore, this indicator may be interpreted much like the better known moving average. Also, the current relationship between price and the current n-day Linear Re- gression Line may be viewed as an oscillator. As shown in the chart, we may divide the current price close by the current trailing 5-day Linear Regression Line of the most recent 5-day closing prices. In MetaStock® formula language, that could be ex- pressed as CLOSE/LinearReg(CLOSE,5). Linear Regression Line 357 Indicator Strategy Example for Linear Regression Line Linear Regression Line is robust, with all period lengths between 2 and 700 days profitable for long trades only (no short selling). Based on an 18-year file of daily data for the entire history of the S&P 500 Composite Stock Price Index futures CSI Perpetual Contract (www.csidata.com) from 4/21/82 to 12/22/00, we found that the following parameters would have produced a positive result on a purely mechan- ical signal basis with no subjectivity, no sophisticated technical analysis, and no judgement: Enter Long (Buy) at the current daily price close of the S&P 500 Com- posite Stock Price Index futures CSI Perpetual Contract when the close is greater than the 5-day Linear Regression Line. Close Long (Sell) at the current daily price close of the S&P 500 Com- posite Stock Price Index futures CSI Perpetual Contract when the close is less than the 5-day Linear Regression Line. Enter Short (Sell Short) never. Starting with $100 and reinvesting profits, total net profits for this Linear Re- gression Slope trend-following strategy would have been $759.88, assuming a fully invested strategy, reinvestment of profits, no transactions costs and no taxes. This would have been 26.04 percent less than buy-and-hold. No short selling would have been profitable, and no short selling was included in the strategy. This long-only Lin- ear Regression Slope variation would have given profitable buy signals 49.38% of the time. Trading would have been hyperactive at one trade every 6.55 calendar days. The Equis International MetaStock® System Testing rules are written as follows: Enter long: CLOSE>LinearReg(CLOSE,opt1) Close long: CLOSE<LinearReg(CLOSE,opt1) OPT1 Current value: 5 360 Technical Market Indicators Linear Regression Slope Linear Regression is a mathematical method for expressing a straight-line relation- ship between any two variables. It is commonly used with price and time data to iden- tify trends. The Linear Regression Slope shows how much prices have changed per unit of time. One possible trend-following decision rule is to use the Linear Regression Slope of the linear regression line for trend following signals. A positive slope (and, there- fore, a rising linear regression line) is bullish, so buy when slope is above zero. A neg- ative slope (and, therefore, a falling linear regression line) is bearish, so sell when slope is above zero. Indicator Strategy Example for Linear Regression Slope Linear Regression Slope is robust, with all period lengths between 2 and 300 days profitable for long trades only (no short selling). Based on a 18-year file of daily data for the entire history of the S&P 500 Composite Stock Price Index futures CSI Per- petual Contract from 4/21/82 to 12/22/00 collected from www.csidata.com, we found that the following parameters would have produced a positive result on a purely me- chanical signal basis with no subjectivity, no sophisticated technical analysis, and no judgement: Enter Long (Buy) at the current daily price close of the S&P 500 Com- posite Stock Price Index futures CSI Perpetual Contract when the 244-day Linear Regression Slope is greater than zero. Close Long (Sell) at the current daily price close of the S&P 500 Com- posite Stock Price Index futures CSI Perpetual Contract when the 244-day Linear Regression Slope is less than zero. Enter Short (Sell Short) never. Linear Regression Slope 361 Starting with $100 and reinvesting profits, total net profits for this Linear Re- gression Slope trend-following strategy would have been $521.98, assuming a fully invested strategy, reinvestment of profits, no transactions costs and no taxes. This would have been 49.19 percent less than buy-and-hold. No short selling would have been profitable, and no short selling was included in the strategy. This long-only Lin- ear Regression Slope variation would have given profitable buy signals 100% of the time, though the sample size of only five trades would not have been significant. Trading would have been inactive at one trade every 1364.20 calendar days. The Equis International MetaStock® System Testing rules are written as follows: Enter long: LinRegSlope(C,opt1)>0 Close long: LinRegSlope(C,opt1)<0 OPT1 Current value: 244 364 Technical Market Indicators Liquidity In technical analysis, liquidity refers to the amount of investable cash and cash equiv- alents held on the sidelines in reserve for future commitment to the market. (See Mu- tual Fund Cash.) Large liquidity represents future buying power and is potentially bullish. On the other hand, low liquidity suggests that buying power is used up and that relatively little cash is in reserve to support prices at current levels, and that is potentially bearish. Far-sighted technical analysts (such as Ralph Acampora, CMT, who quite correctly forecasted Dow 7,000 then 10,000, years in advance) take into account distant future liquidity and money flows based on long-term demographic projections. Trading liquidity refers to the amount of trading activity, the ease and rapidity of executions, the narrowness of spreads, the size of real bids and offers (depth of the market), and the absence of slippage on market orders. Active traders who act on short-term timing signals should focus only on active and deep markets, otherwise slippage on executions could erode theoretical paper profits. Even the most liquid markets suffer from occasional order imbalances in so called ‘fast markets.’ Trading at times of big news events or other general mass emo- tional excess can be surprisingly costly. In fast markets, going with the majority, buy- ing when everyone else wants to buy, or selling when everyone else wants to sell, often results in shockingly bad fills (executions). It also offers a good probability of buying at the top and selling at the bottom, which is the formula for instant losses. Conversely, doing just the opposite, going against the majority at times of general emotional excessive reactions, if timed well, can result in unusually good fills. Good or bad executions make a very big difference real trading. Inactive markets with low volume and few participants generally have the widest bid-ask spreads and largest slippage on market orders. Executions on market orders for inactive, illiquid instruments in fast markets can be extremely costly, with very large slippage. Patience and limit orders may limit the damage. Livermore Swing System, Livermore Penetration Filter The Livermore Swing System was developed by a famous speculator, Jesse Liver- more, in the 1920’s. This system uses two filters: a swing filter of x%, and a penetra- tion filter of one-half the size of the swing filter. An uptrend is defined on the swing chart by higher highs and higher lows. A downtrend is defined on the swing chart by lower lows and lower highs. For example, assume a swing filter 4% and a penetration filter of 2%. After a downtrend, which is a series of lower lows and lower highs, close out short positions Lowry’s Reports 365 when price rises by the amount of the swing filter (4%) and exceeds the most recent previous swing high by the amount of the penetration filter (2%). Next, establish new long positions when the next most recent previous swing high is exceeded by the amount of the penetration filter (2%). Thus, the two most recent swing highs each must be exceeded by 2% in order to completely reverse from short to long. Conversely, after an uptrend, which is a series of higher highs and higher lows, close out long positions when price falls by the amount of the swing filter (4%) and breaks the most recent previous swing low by the amount of the penetration filter (2%). Next, establish new short positions when the next most recent previous swing low is broken by the amount of the penetration filter (2%). Thus, the two most recent swing lows each must be broken by 2% in order to completely reverse from long to short. Lowry’s Reports In 1938, the late Lyman M. Lowry originated the idea of compiling Upside and Downside Volume statistics in an effort to objectively quantify the basic forces of demand and supply for stocks and the underlying condition of the stock market in general. The company he founded, Lowry’s Reports, publishes proprietary indices of Buying Power and Selling Pressure, NYSE Operating-Companies-Only Statistics, Advance-Decline, Points Gained and Lost, and Upside and Downside Volume. These indices use raw statistics for all domestic, ordinary New York Stock Exchange listed common stock issues, while specifically excluding all preferred stocks, ADRS, closed end mutual funds, REITS and other non-ordinary issues. In addition, Lowry offers proprietary Power Ratings to analyze sectors, industry groups, and individual stocks. Preprocessed technical indicators, both current and historical data, but not the actual proprietary algorithms, may be purchased from Lowry’s Reports, Inc., 631 U.S. Highway 1, #305, North Palm Beach, FL 33408, Phone (561) 842-3514, www.lowryreports.com. The chart (courtesy of Ned Davis Research), shows that Lowry’s Short-Term Buying Power oscillator fully oversold levels below 60 appear to have effectively identified major market bottoms. Also, this oscillator has given some useful diver- gence signals, such as a higher low at the 1982 market bottom and a lower high at the 1987 market top. In contrast, reflecting the increasing levels of price and volume, the longer-term Buying Power and Selling Pressure lines have shown a distinct upward bias, but that still did not prevent them from giving misleading negative divergences at the bottoms of 1987, 1990, 1992, 1994, 1996, and 1997. Obviously, these lines re- quire a different and more complex interpretation, compared to most other indicators. Lowry’s Reports 367 According to Bishop and Rollins, general market activity can be reduced to four basic totals: • Total dollars gained each day; • Total volume of transactions for stocks moving up; • Total dollars lost each day; • Total volume of transactions for stocks moving down. To smooth out short-term fluctuations, Lowry’s aggregates these totals over ap- proximately 50 and 15 trading days to produce long and short term indices of supply and demand. Lowry’s employs specific rules for interpretation, involving overbought and oversold conditions, signs showing when prevailing pressures are dissipating, and Safety Controls to alert users when to cut losses on existing positions. In a study us- ing 25 years of past daily data applying all of Lowry’s interpretation rules, Bishop and Rollins concluded that the Lowry’s Reports signals ‘led to returns significantly in ex- cess of those achieved by naïve buy-and-hold programs’ from 1950 to 1975. Also, ‘. . . this study indicated that extraordinary gains can be achieved by sophisticated technical analysis . . . ‘ For complete details, see Bishop, E. L., & Rollins, J. R. (1975: Dec).

Indicator Strategy Example of Lowry’s Buying Power minus Selling Pressure The full array of Lowry’s proprietary indicators and complex decision rules for inter- pretation are beyond the scope of this book. Even a simple computer scan of Lowry’s data indicates information of value. Historical data provided by UST Securities shows that for Buying Power minus Selling Pressure, the most basic form of trend following would have been effective, on both the long side and the short side. We emphasize that Lowry’s never intended for its indicators to be used this way. Nevertheless, based on the daily prices for the Dow-Jones Industrial Average for 61 years from 1940 to 2001, we found that the following parameters would have produced a positive result on a purely mechanical trend-following signal basis with no subjectivity, no sophisti- cated technical analysis, and no judgement: Enter Long (Buy) at the current daily price close of the DJIA when the current net of Lowry’s Buying Power minus Selling Pressure rises to a level equal to or above yesterday’s net reading. Close Long (Sell) at the current daily price close of the DJIA when the current net of Lowry’s Buying Power minus Selling Pressure falls below yesterday’s net reading. 370 Technical Market Indicators Enter Short (Sell Short) at the current daily price close of the DJIA when the current net of Lowry’s Buying Power minus Selling Pressure falls be- low yesterday’s net reading. Close Short (Cover) at the current daily price close of the DJIA when the current net of Lowry’s Buying Power minus Selling Pressure rises to a level equal to or above yesterday’s net reading. Starting with $100 and reinvesting profits, total net profits for this Lowry’s Buy- ing Power minus Selling Pressure short-term trend following strategy would have been $84,092,160, assuming a fully invested strategy, reinvestment of profits, no transactions costs and no taxes. This would have been 1,216,146.87 percent better than buy-and-hold. Even short selling would have been profitable, and short selling was included in the strategy. Trading would have been hyperactive at one trade every 3.32 calendar days. The Equis International MetaStock® System Testing rules, where Lowry’s Buy- ing Power minus Selling Pressure is inserted into the data field normally reserved for volume, are written as follows: Enter long: V > Ref(Mov(V,opt1,E),-1) Close long: V < Ref(Mov(V,opt1,E),-1) Enter short: V < Ref(Mov(V,opt1,E),-1) Close short: V > Ref(Mov(V,opt1,E),-1) OPT1 Current value: 1 Indicator Strategy Example Using Lowry’s Short-Term Buying Power Lowry’s also offers a short-term version of Buying Power. Using the exact same primitive trend rule as above, results would have been slightly better for this more sensitive version. Based on the daily prices for the DJIA for 61 years from 1940 to 2001, we found that the following parameters would have produced a positive result on a purely mechanical trend-following signal basis with no subjectivity, no sophisti- cated technical analysis, and no judgement: Lowry’s Reports 371 Enter Long (Buy) at the current daily price close of the DJIA when the current Lowry’s Short-Term Buying Power rises to a level equal to or above yesterday’s reading. Close Long (Sell) at the current daily price close of the DJIA when the current Lowry’s Short-Term Buying Power falls below yesterday’s reading. Enter Short (Sell Short) at the current daily price close of the DJIA when the current Lowry’s Short-Term Buying Power falls below yesterday’s reading. Close Short (Cover) at the current daily price close of the DJIA when the current Lowry’s Short-Term Buying Power rises to a level equal to or above yesterday’s reading. Starting with $100 and reinvesting profits, total net profits for this Lowry’s Short-Term Buying Power trend following strategy would have been $84,402,688, as- suming a fully invested strategy, reinvestment of profits, no transactions costs and no taxes. This would have been 1,220,638.12 percent better than buy-and-hold. Even short selling would have been profitable, and short selling was included in the strat- egy. Trading would have been hyperactive at one trade every 3.37 calendar days. The Equis International MetaStock® System Testing rules, where Lowry’s Short-Term Buying Power is inserted into the data field normally reserved for vol- ume, are written as follows: Enter long: V > Ref(Mov(V,opt1,E),-1) Close long: V < Ref(Mov(V,opt1,E),-1) Enter short: V < Ref(Mov(V,opt1,E),-1) Close short: V > Ref(Mov(V,opt1,E),-1) OPT1 Current value: 1 374 Technical Market Indicators Lucas Numbers French mathematician Edouard Lucas (1842–91) described a two-term difference se- quence of integers similar to the Fibonacci number sequence, where the next number in the sequence is the sum of the previous two numbers. The Lucas difference is the starting point or the initial values, which are the integers 2 and 1, in that reverse or- der. Thus, Lucas derived the following sequence: 2, 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18, 29, 47, 76, 123, 199, 322, 421, 743, 1164, . . . Lucas Numbers are not as well-known nor as widely used as the much more popular Fibonacci Numbers. Margin Debt 375 Margin The initial margin requirement is set by the Fed or the exchange. For most stocks, 50% of the purchase price is required. (For the riskiest stocks 100% is required.) The investor lays out half of the total purchase price, and his broker lends him the re- maining 50% with interest. The initial margin requirement is usually much less for most futures contracts. Margin offers both opportunity and substantial danger. Lever- age is defined as 100% minus margin. Leverage and margin are two-edged swords that must be handled with care. Margin Debt Margin Debt represents the total amount that customers owe their brokerage firms as a result of borrowing through their stock margin accounts. Margin Debt statistics are released on a monthly basis by the New York Stock Exchange. Most of the time, margin debt follows the trend of the market and yields few significant clues for market timing. In a general bull market trend, the percentage of troubled margin accounts, with equity less than 40%, drops to a low level. Such a market is healthy and not vulnerable to involuntary margin selling on normal price pullbacks. In the later stages of a bear market, however, margin debt becomes more inter- esting. After stock prices already have dropped substantially, the percentage of mar- gin debt in troubled accounts, with equity less than 40%, rises to high levels. In the event of any further significant decline in stock prices, such accounts are vulnerable to forced liquidation through margin calls. This can create an avalanche of selling, producing a selling climax, and a final clean-out of the weak hands. Once the selling runs its course and troubled margin accounts are fully liquidated, stock prices spring back, up sharply from a deeply oversold condition. Indicator Strategy Example for Margin Debt, with Overbought/Oversold Brackets Based on a 36-year file of monthly data for Margin Debt on the New York Stock Ex- change and the DJIA since January, 1965, we found that a Overbought/Oversold Bracket Rule would have produced a positive result on a purely mechanical signal ba- sis with no subjectivity, no sophisticated technical analysis, and no judgement: Enter Long (Buy) at the current month-end price close of the DJIA when the current month’s annual rate of change of Margin Debt crosses from be- low 1% to above 1%. 378 Technical Market Indicators Close Long (Sell) at the current month-end price close of the DJIA when the current month’s annual rate of change of Margin Debt crosses from above 50% to below 50%. Enter Short (Sell Short) at the current month-end price close of the DJIA when the current month’s annual rate of change of Margin Debt crosses from above 50% to below 50%. Close Short (Cover) at the current month-end price close of the DJIA when the current month’s annual rate of change of Margin Debt crosses from below 1% to above 1%. Starting with $100 and reinvesting profits, total net profits for the Margin Debt Brackets strategy would have been $2,028.70, assuming a fully invested strategy, reinvestment of profits, no transactions costs and no taxes. This would have been 111.56 percent greater than buy-and-hold. Even short selling would have been prof- itable, and short selling was included in the strategy. Two-thirds of the short sales would have been profitable, while 100% of the long trades would have been prof- itable. Trading would have been inactive at one trade every 1817.71 calendar days. The Equis International MetaStock® System Testing rules, where the Margin Debt is inserted into the data field normally reserved for Volume (V), are written as follows: Enter long: Ref((((V-Ref(V,-12))/Ref(V,-12))*100),-1)<49-opt2 AND (((V-Ref(V,-12))/Ref(V,-12))*100)>49-opt2 Close long: Ref((((V-Ref(V,-12))/Ref(V,-12))*100),-1)>opt1 AND (((V-Ref(V,-12))/Ref(V,-12))*100)<opt1 Enter short: Ref((((V-Ref(V,-12))/Ref(V,-12))*100),-1)>opt1 AND (((V-Ref(V,-12))/Ref(V,-12))*100)<opt1 Close short: Ref((((V-Ref(V,-12))/Ref(V,-12))*100),-1)<49-opt2 AND (((V-Ref(V,-12))/Ref(V,-12))*100)>49-opt2 OPT1 Current value: 50 OPT2 Current value: 50 Indicator Strategy Example for Margin Debt–Trend Following As the chart shows, the trend of Margin Debt appears to correlate with the trend of the stock market. Based on a 34-year file of monthly data for Margin Debt on the New York Stock Exchange and the DJIA since March, 1967, we found that all simple 380 Technical Market Indicators trend-following rules would have produced positive results on a purely mechanical signal basis with no subjectivity, no sophisticated technical analysis, and no judgement: Enter Long (Buy) at the current month-end price close of the DJIA when the current month’s Margin Debt crosses above its own trailing 13-month Exponential Moving Average as of the previous month. Close Long (Sell) at the current month-end price close of the DJIA when the current month’s Margin Debt crosses below its own trailing 13-month Exponential Moving Average as of the previous month. Enter Short (Sell Short) never. Starting with $100 and reinvesting profits, total net profits for this Margin Debt trend-following strategy would have been $553.83, assuming a fully invested strat- egy, reinvestment of profits, no transactions costs and no taxes. This would have been 43.71 percent less than buy-and-hold. No short selling would have been profitable, and no short selling was included in the strategy. Short selling would have cut net profit by 64%. Although this strategy does not keep pace with the passive buy-and- hold strategy, Margin Debt as a trend-following strategy would have been right on 9 of 13 signals, for 69.23% winning trades. Trading would have been inactive at one trade every 985.85 calendar days. The Equis International MetaStock® System Testing rules, where the Margin Debt is inserted into the data field normally reserved for Volume (V), are written as follows: Enter long: V > Ref(Mov(V,opt1,E),-1) Close long: V < Ref(Mov(V,opt1,E),-1) OPT1 Current value: 13 Margin Requirement The Margin Requirement is the minimum percentage of the total value of a position that an investor is required to put down as equity or collateral. With the Margin Requirement at 50%, the investor is required to put down at least half of the total purchase price. His broker will lend him the remaining 50%, and charge him interest on it. The Federal Reserve Board Fed has kept the Margin Requirement unchanged at 50% since January 1974. So, it appears that the Fed no longer uses the Margin Re- quirement as a tool of monetary policy. Between 1934 to 1974, the Fed increased the Market Profile 381 Margin Requirement 12 times and lowered it 10 times. The Fed raised the Margin Re- quirement to force investors to put up more money to buy stock and to dampen spec- ulation. The Fed cut the Margin Requirement after significant declines in the stock market to make it easier for investors to hold and buy more stock. Critics of the Fed insist that the Fed should not be in the business of manipulating stock prices. Although this indicator has been gathering dust for decades, the stock market used to react to changes in the Margin Requirement. Norman Fosback, in his 1976 book, Stock Market Logic (The Institute for Econometric Research, 3471 North Fed- eral Highway, Fort Lauderdale, FL 33306), found that the stock market’s initial reac- tion to increases in the Margin Requirement has been negative. But by the end of the first month after such an increase, the stock market recovered, rising 1.1% on aver- age, as measured by the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. One year after an increase, the market rose 14.4%, a rate of gain significantly above normal. Furthermore, Fosback discovered that the market initially declined an average of 2.3% three months after a reduction in the Margin Requirement, contrary to what one might expect. This might imply that in a bear market, the downward momentum is not quickly stemmed. But following that short-term decline, the market reversed to the upside, gaining above-average amounts of 12.5%, 16.3%, and 18.5%, in the 12 months, 15 months, and 18 months following a Margin Requirement reduction, re- spectively. So, longer term, after an initial disappointment, cuts in the Margin Re- quirement indeed have been bullish. Market Profile Market Profile is a statistical frequency distribution of tick data designed to reveal how many trades occurred at each specific price during each trading session. It re- veals the market balance or imbalance as well as precise levels of support and resis- tance on a micro level. When there is a significant quantity of trading activity at a specific price, that price becomes established as the value in traders’ minds. When price moves away from value then returns to value, price finds support or resistance at value. Market Profile gained a dedicated following among some sophisticated short-term traders but has not attained widespread use among investors or techni- cians. Source: Steidlemayer, J. P., & Koy, K.

MACD is calculated in three steps: 1. Calculate the point spread difference between two Exponential Moving Av- erages (EMA) of the closing price: a slower, 26-day EMA (using a smooth- ing constant of .075) is subtracted from a faster 12-day EMA (using a smoothing constant of 0.15). Plot this differential oscillator, which measures price velocity. 2. Smooth this price velocity with an even faster 9-day EMA (with a smoothing constant of 0.2). Plot this signal line. 3. Calculate a second differential oscillator by subtracting the signal line from the price velocity. Plot this measure of price acceleration as a histogram. Appel sometimes uses different lengths for the EMAs, depending on the behav- ior of the security and trading objectives, shorter or longer term. He also analyses longer-term perspectives using weekly data, based only on the closing price for the last day of each week. Appel has shown that his basic MACD concept is adaptable to any time-frame. Appel does not advocate a simple mechanical rule for interpreting MACD. Rather, Appel has published proprietary decision rules he offers for sale in a research report and video tape. Indicator Strategy Example for MACD MACD requires experience and judgement to use as Appel intended. Even naïve test- ing assumptions suggest that MACD may have some objective potential value as a purely mechanical, trend-following technical indicator. The majority of monthly buy signals would have been profitable, for long trades only. MACD would have slightly outperformed the passive buy-and-hold strategy for long trades only, while short sell- ing would not have been profitable. Based on a 72-year file of month-end closing price data for the DJIA from 11/28 to 12/00, we found that the following parameters would have produced a positive re- sult on a purely mechanical trend-following signal basis with no subjectivity, no so- phisticated technical analysis, and no judgement: Moving Average Convergence-Divergence Trading Method (MACD) 413 Enter Long (Buy) at the current month-end price close of the DJIA when the MACD (the 12-month EMA minus the 26-month EMA) crosses above its own Signal Line (the 9-month EMA of the difference between the 12- month EMA minus the 26-month EMA). Close Long (Sell) at the current month-end price close of the DJIA when the MACD (the 12-month EMA minus the 26-month EMA) crosses below its own Signal Line (the 9-month EMA of the difference between the 12- month EMA minus the 26-month EMA). Enter Short (Sell Short) never. Starting with $100 and reinvesting profits, total net profits for this MACD trend-following strategy would have been $3,586.55, assuming a fully invested strat- egy, reinvestment of profits, no transactions costs and no taxes. This would have been 0.99 percent greater than buy-and-hold. No short selling would have been profitable, and no short selling was included in the strategy. Short selling would have cut the profit by 84%, to much less than buy-and-hold. Long-only MACD as an indicator would have given profitable buy signals 58.62% of the time. Trading would have been extremely inactive at one trade every 907.14 calendar days. Note that this strat- egy considers month-end closing prices only while ignoring everything in between. The Equis International MetaStock® System Testing rules for MACD are writ- ten as follows: Enter long: Cross(MACD(),Mov(MACD(),opt1,E)) Close long: Cross(Mov(MACD(),opt1,E),MACD()) OPT1 Current value: 9 416 Technical Market Indicators Moving Average Filters and Multiple Confirmation Moving Average Filters and Multiple Confirmation uses one or more longer moving averages to filter the signals of a shorter moving average. These reduce the trading frequency compared to using any one moving average alone. For example, using just two different moving averages, one short-term and one long-term, buy when price is above the short-term moving average and is above the long-term moving average; and sell when price is below the short-term moving aver- age and is below the long-term moving average. A very different result is obtained when we substitute the word or for and in the decision rule above. Trading frequency is much higher for or than for and. Moving Average Oscillators (See Price Oscillator.) Moving Average Slope The Moving Average Slope subtracts the moving average level n-periods ago from the current moving average level. For example, a recent magazine article referred to slope as the 80-day simple moving average of the daily closing price minus the level of the same 80-day simple moving average 10-days previous. We have tried all the many variations on this theme, and we prefer the moving average crossover because it is more effective. Some people fool themselves by using different indicators that are, in effect, the exact equivalent of one another. For example, it is curious to note that an exponential moving average changes slope from down to up or from up to down at the same time that the close crosses the exponential moving average. An n-period simple moving average changes slope from down to up or from up to down at the same time that an n-period rate of change crosses zero. An n-period weighted moving average changes slope from down to up or from up to down at the same time that the close crosses a simple moving average of length n-1 periods. Seemingly different indicators some- times produce the same results. Watch out for multicolinearity. Multicolinearity John Bollinger, CFA, CMT, has correctly pointed out that multicolinearity is the dan- gerous illusion of weighing the same basic information in slightly different forms, Multiple Time Frame Analysis Using Exponential Moving Average Crossover Rules 417 while erroneously expecting independent verification. Smart analysts avoid this trap. Note that using several different momentum indicators derived from the same series of closing prices over the same time period to confirm each other is not correct inde- pendent verification, instead it is counting the same thing several times. For example, combining RSI, Stochastics, MACD, Momentum, and Rate-of-Change is not the same as weighing different independent indicators, since they are all based on closing price velocity. To avoid this trap, an analyst could choose one indicator derived from closing prices, another from volume, another from price range, another from relative strength (not RSI), another from sentiment, and perhaps even another from a different market, such as using interest-rates in a stock model. A variety of time-frames, either short, in- termediate, or long, may also add a valuable cross-check to the analysis. Multiple Time Frame Analysis Using Exponential Moving Average Crossover Rules Perhaps the most widely used technical indicator of all is the moving average crossover rule: buy when the daily price close crosses above the moving average and sell when the daily price close crosses under the moving average. This strategy pre- dates computers and electronic calculators. It is probably no coincidence that the tra- ditional moving average lengths are based on the number ten: 10 months (about 200 trading days), 10 weeks (about 50 trading days), and 10 days. It takes scant comput- ing power to add together 10 numbers, then divide that sum by 10, which involves simply shifting the decimal point one place to the left. These specific lengths are well established in technical analysis literature and the popular media, so criticisms of hindsight curve fitting do not apply. (For a 65-year old reference citing these specific moving average lengths, see Gartley, H. M., Profits in the Stock Market, Lambert- Gann Publishing Co., Box O, Pomeroy WA., 1935.) The use of three moving averages works well with the ancient (more than a cen- tury old) technical analysis approach of multiple time frame analysis for determining trends of three degrees. Borrowing the language of Charles Dow’s theory, • Start with the long-term, Primary Tide, which is fairly effectively captured by the 200-day moving average. • Next, narrow your focus to the intermediate-term, Secondary Wave, which is captured by the 50-day moving average. • Finally, fine tune with the short-term, Minor Ripple, captured by the 10-day moving average. 418 Technical Market Indicators The decision rules for risk-averse profit maximization are clear and unambiguous: • buy when the daily price close crosses above all three moving averages; • sell long when the daily price close crosses under any of the three moving averages; • sell short when the daily price close crosses under all three moving averages; • cover short when the daily price close crosses above any of the three mov- ing averages. Indicator Strategy Example for Multiple Time Frame Exponential Moving Averages To be consistent with our general testing protocol in this book, we substituted expo- nential moving averages for the more traditional simple moving averages of equiva- lent length. Also, we compared today’s close with yesterday’s exponential moving averages to recognize our trading signals (since we can’t trade today based on a mov- ing average we can’t calculate yet because we don’t yet have today’s closing price). These small refinements not only offer greater realism in historical simulation, but also improve the performance of most systems by reducing the well-known lag-time associated with moving averages. Historical data shows that this multiple time frame analysis for determining trends of three degrees outperformed the passive buy-and-hold strategy by an ex- tremely large margin, more than 144 fold. Based on the daily closing prices for the DJIA for 101 years from 1900 to 2001, we found that the following parameters would have produced good results on a purely mechanical trend-following signal basis with no subjectivity, no sophisticated technical analysis, and no judgement: Enter Long (Buy) at the current daily price close of the DJIA when that daily close is above all three exponential moving averages, specifically the 10-day, 50-day, and 200-day exponential moving averages of the daily closing price. Close Long (Sell) at the current daily price close of the DJIA when that daily close is below any of the three exponential moving averages, specif- ically the 10-day, 50-day, or 200-day exponential moving averages of the daily closing price. Enter Short (Sell Short) at the current daily price close of the DJIA when that daily close is below all three exponential moving averages, specifi- cally the 10-day, 50-day, and 200-day exponential moving averages of the daily closing price. Multiple Time Frame Analysis Using Exponential Moving Average Crossover Rules 419 Close Short (Cover) at the current daily price close of the DJIA when that daily close is above any of the three exponential moving averages, specif- ically the 10-day, 50-day, or 200-day exponential moving averages of the daily closing price. Starting with $100 and reinvesting profits, total net profits for this multiple time frame trend-following strategy would have been $3,189,323.50, assuming a fully invested strategy, reinvestment of profits, no transactions costs and no taxes. This would have been 14,324.15 percent greater than buy-and-hold. Short selling would have been profitable, although not since 1987, and short selling was included in the strategy. Long and short signals together would have given profitable signals only 35.75% of the time, but winning trades were larger than losing trades. Trading would have been extremely active at one trade every 15.03 calendar days. The Equis International MetaStock® System Testing rules are written as follows: Enter long: CLOSE > Ref(Mov(CLOSE,opt1,E),-1) AND CLOSE > Ref(Mov(CLOSE,opt2,E),-1) AND CLOSE > Ref(Mov(CLOSE,opt3,E),-1) Close long: CLOSE < Ref(Mov(CLOSE,opt1,E),-1) OR CLOSE < Ref(Mov(CLOSE,opt2,E),-1) OR CLOSE < Ref(Mov(CLOSE,opt3,E),-1) Enter short: CLOSE < Ref(Mov(CLOSE,opt1,E),-1) AND CLOSE < Ref(Mov(CLOSE,opt2,E),-1) AND CLOSE < Ref(Mov(CLOSE,opt3,E),-1) Close short: CLOSE > Ref(Mov(CLOSE,opt1,E),-1) OR CLOSE > Ref(Mov(CLOSE,opt2,E),-1) OR CLOSE > Ref(Mov(CLOSE,opt3,E),-1) OPT1 Current value: 10 OPT2 Current value: 50 OPT3 Current value: 200 422 Technical Market Indicators Mutual Funds Cash/Assets Ratio The Mutual Funds Cash/Assets Ratio is cash and cash equivalents held by mutual funds divided by the total assets of mutual funds. Each month, the Investment Com- pany Institute (1775 K Street, N.W., Washington, DC 20006) reports detailed statis- tics on the portfolio holdings of mutual funds. The Mutual Funds Cash/Assets Ratio may be viewed as a sample of available buying power for the general stock market. Mutual Fund portfolio managers are sim- ilar to the broader universe of all professional money managers. When their Cash/As- sets Ratio is relatively high as compared to historical norms, then relatively more cash is available to buy stocks, and that is potential fuel for a bullish trend, other things be- ing equal. But when their Cash/Assets Ratio is relatively low, then relatively little cash is left to buy stocks or support prices, so the market may be vulnerable to a de- cline, other things being equal. It is important to note, however, that, other things are not always equal, and sentiment indicators should be used only as supplements to more precise technical timing indicators. As the chart of Stock Mutual Funds Cash/Assets Ratio by Ned Davis Research shows, the S&P 500 has made strong gains of 20.1% per annum after cash rose above 9.5% of assets. In contrast, S&P 500 gains were only 2.1% per annum after cash fell to 6.9% of assets. This indicator has not given timely signals in recent years, however, and it appears that its characteristics may have changed. 424 Technical Market Indicators N-Day Rule The N-Day Rule has us buy when the current price high rises above the previous n days’ highest price high. Sell when the current price low falls below the previous n days’ lowest price low. This is simply another name for the Price Channel Trading Range Breakout Rule. (See Price Channel Trading Range Breakout Rule.) Negative Volume Index (NVI) The Negative Volume Index, created by Paul Dysart, cumulates net price change for periods of declining volume only. The idea is that mainly smart professional traders buy and sell during relatively quiet periods of declining volume. In contrast, unpro- fessional, emotionally driven players are active on days when volume rises. There- fore, market activity on days when a negative change in volume occurs should better reflect the thinking of the smart-money professionals who treat trading as a serious business rather than as some wild casino game. NVI may be calculated for any time interval, such as minutes, hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly. Moreover, NVI may be calculated using any market index, stock or commodity, as long as there is data for closing price and volume. The volume itself is used only as a qualifier to determine whether or not to include the day’s net price change fractional ratio in the cumulative total. If volume today is less than vol- ume yesterday, then today’s net price change fractional ratio is included in the cumu- lative total. But if the volume today is greater than the volume of the previous day, then today’s net price change fractional ratio is not included in the cumulative total. Thus, NVI is defined as a cumulative total of daily price change fractional ratios for declining volume days only. To calculate the Negative Volume Index, compare the current day’s volume to the previous day’s volume. If today’s volume is greater than yesterday’s volume, then today does not qualify as a Negative Volume day; therefore today’s net price change is assumed to be zero and the Negative Volume Index remains unchanged at yester- day’s level. But, if today’s volume is less than yesterday’s volume, today does qual- ify as a Negative Volume day. Then, we divide the current day’s net price change (respecting the sign, plus for a net gain, or minus for a net loss) by the closing price yesterday to arrive at today’s net price change fractional ratio. Finally, we add today’s plus or minus net price change fractional ratio to a cumulative total to arrive at the Negative Volume Index. Thus, NVI rises on days of positive price change on lower volume, NVI falls on days of negative price change on lower volume, and NVI is unchanged on days of higher volume no matter what the price action. Negative Volume Index (NVI) 425 In MetaStock®’s Indicator Builder dialogue, NVI may be expressed by the following: Cum(If(V<Ref(V,-1),ROC(C,1,%),0)) The step-by-step literal translation is: ‘Cumulate the following: If the current volume is less than the previous period’s volume, then compute the Rate-of-Change of the Closing price for one period, expressed as a percentage; otherwise (if the cur- rent volume is greater than the previous volume), set the day’s Rate-of-Change of the Closing price to zero before cumulating.’ Norman Fosback (The Institute for Econometric Research, 3471 North Federal Highway, Forth Lauderdale, FL 33306) found that when NVI was above its own trail- ing moving average, that indicated positive returns for the stock market. Our inde- pendent testing confirmed this across all moving average period lengths (see below). Indicator Strategy Example for the Negative Volume Index (NVI) Historical data shows that the Negative Volume Index produces a modestly positive result on the long side. NVI under performed the buy-and-hold strategy because of heavy long-side losses from 1929 to 1933. Short selling strategies all lost money. Based on the number of shares traded each day on the NYSE and the daily prices for the DJIA for 72 years from 1928 to 2000, we found that the following parameters would have produced a positive result on a purely mechanical trend-following signal basis with no subjectivity, no sophisticated technical analysis, and no judgement: Enter Long (Buy) at the current daily price close of the DJIA when the current Negative Volume Index is greater than the previous day’s Negative Volume Index. Close Long (Sell) at the current daily price close of the DJIA when the current Negative Volume Index is less than the previous day’s Negative Volume Index. Enter Short (Sell Short) never. Starting with $100 and reinvesting profits, total net profits for this Negative Vol- ume Index strategy would have been $3,096.88, assuming a fully invested strategy, reinvestment of profits, no transactions costs and no taxes. This would have been 32.31 percent less than buy-and-hold. Only about 46.27 percent of the 2213 signals would have produced winning trades, and the average long trade lasted 11.87 trading days on average. Short selling, which was not included in this strategy, would have lost money. 480 Technical Market Indicators Ohama’s 3-D Technique Bill Ohama identified three futures markets that by logic and actual practice trade to- gether: crude oil, heating oil, and gasoline. When prices of these three contracts di- verge, Ohama enters a trade designed to take advantage of expected realignment. (See LeBeau, C. & Lucas, D. W. (1992). Technical Traders Guide to Computer Analysis of the Futures Market. Homewood, IL: Business One Irwin.) In trading Intermarket Divergences, the trader initiates a trade when prices of fi- nancial instruments diverge, or do not move proportionately to a similar extent, or in a similar direction. He may buy one and short the other in an attempt to take advan- tage of possible price movement before these financial instruments come back into alignment. The risk is that on occasion there is a good reason for the divergence and the misalignment persists or even intensifies. There are no guarantees on timely realign- ment. This risk hit, in a dramatic way, Long Term Capital Management, which quickly lost so many billions of dollars betting on normality that it required a massive government-sponsored financial bailout in 1998. On-Balance Volume (See Volume: On-Balance Volume (OBV).) Open Interest Open interest is the total commitment of longs or shorts in a futures market. Since the number of contracts held long must equal the number of contracts held short, open in- terest is either the number of contracts held long or the number of contracts held short. In other words, open interest is the number of contracts held long plus the num- ber of contracts held short, divided by two. In the conventional interpretation, when open interest is trending upward or ris- ing, the prevailing price trend is confirmed—whatever it is, up, down or neutral. The prevailing price trend is likely to continue. Rising open interest means that new posi- tions are being established that reinforce the existing trend. Open interest tends to en- ter an uptrend when the price of the underlying futures contract enters a directional trend, as new trend-following positions are attracted by the trend. When open interest reverses trend from up to down, existing positions are liqui- dated or closed out faster than new positions enter the market. The prevailing price uptrend or downtrend is unsustainable. Some complicate the analysis further by adding volume as another variable. Volume should be trending in the same direction as open interest in order to confirm the conclusion. Open Interest 481 The following table expresses the relationships between price trends and open interest trends. The simple rule of thumb is that when both price and open interest are trending in the same direction, the future is bullish, so prices should trend higher. But when price and open interest are trending in opposite directions, the future is bearish, so prices should trend lower.

Based on an 18-year file of daily data for the entire history of the S&P 500 Composite Stock Price Index Futures Contract from 4/21/82 to 12/29/00 (Perpetual Contract data collected from www.csidata.com), we found that the following parameters would have produced a positive result on a purely mechanical overbought/oversold signal basis with no sub- jectivity, no sophisticated technical analysis, and no judgement: Enter Long (Buy) at the current daily price close of the S&P 500 Com- posite Stock Price Index futures Perpetual Contract when this contract is above its previous day’s 145-day EMA and this contract’s current Open Interest is above its previous day’s 314-day EMA. Alternately, buy when this contract is below its previous day’s 145-day EMA and this contract’s current Open Interest is below its previous day’s 314-day EMA. Close Long (Sell) at the current daily price close of the S&P 500 Com- posite Stock Price Index futures Perpetual Contract when this contract is below its previous day’s 145-day EMA and this contract’s current Open Interest is above its previous day’s 314-day EMA.

Starting with $100 and reinvesting profits, total net profits for this Open Inter- est strategy would have been $1208.84, assuming a fully invested strategy, reinvest- ment of profits, no transactions costs and no taxes. This would have been 16.85 percent better than buy-and-hold. Short selling would have been profitable and was included in the strategy. The Open Interest as a long and short strategy would have given profitable buy signals 57.68% of the time. Trading would have been moderately active at one trade every 21.40 calendar days.

Open Interest, Larry Williams’ Variation Larry Williams has a different interpretation from the usual one. In his view, open in- terest is primarily an indicator of short selling by big commercials or the professional smart money players who dominate the futures markets, and who are usually right. Changes of 25% or more in open interest indicate that the big boys are making big bets, and we should bet with them. When open interest rises, commercials are shorting. This is bearish, particularly in a contango market or a normal market, where the nearby contracts are trading at a discount to the far out dated contracts. Prices are likely to trend down. On the other hand, open interest drops when commercials cover shorts. This is bullish, particularly in a backwardation and inverted market. Backwardation describes an abnormal market, where the nearby contracts are trading at a premium to the far-out dated contracts, expiring further into the future. Prices are likely to trend up. In a strongly bullish price uptrend, if price falls sharply against the main trend while open interest falls sharply, commercials are covering their shorts into the price weakness, and that is bullish. In a significant bearish price downtrend, if price rallies sharply against the main trend while open interest rises sharply, commercials are shorting into the price strength, and that is bearish. For further discussion of this analysis by Larry R. Williams, see Robbins, Joel (1995). High Performance Futures Trading. Chicago, IL: Probus Publishing (pp 227–250). Indicator Strategy Example for Larry Williams’ Variation on Open Interest For stock index futures, the simplest form of Larry Williams’ interpretation, trading against the trend of Open Interest, produced a loss over all time frames. Whenever we find an unexpected, consistently negative result, we test for the opposite conditions. Indeed, trading with the trend of Open Interest produced a profit over all time frames.

Generally speak- ing, the shorter the time until expiration, then the less valuable the option— other things being equal. Keep in mind that there are absolutely no guarantees that other things will be equal. • Expiration is the critical date when the option ceases to exist, and this is a sure thing. Trading activity and liquidity usually start to decline before ex- piration, so pay attention to the calendar. Watch volume and open interest. Generally, it pays to close out long positions more than a month before ex- piration because of the acceleration of time-premium decay factor as expira- tion approaches. Stock and stock index options expire on the Saturday following the third Friday of each month. The last day to trade is that Fri- day. Four times a year, stock options, index futures, and index options ex- pire on the Saturday following the third Friday of March, June, September, and December. These dates, known as triple witching days, have been un- usually volatile. Pay attention to days both after and, especially, before expiration. Oscillators Oscillators quantify velocity, and they express the speed at which a data series is moving. These versatile indicators are used to express the velocity of price, breadth, volume, sentiment, fundamental indicators, or any combination of variables. Some of the more popular price oscillators include Stochastics, Relative Strength Index (RSI), and the ratio of or difference between two moving averages. (See Price Oscillators: Moving Average Oscillators.) They are usually constructed from market data covering the past one to four weeks; however, they may be adapted to any time frame. An oscillator typically swings up and down around a median point that func- tions as an anchor and as an attractor. This typically may be zero, one, or fifty—de- pending how the oscillator formula is structured. This median point marks a neutral point and a dividing line between positive and negative momentum. The number is used as a signal threshold, although crossing the neutral zone will often be somewhat late in the price move. There may be maximum and minimum limits built into the oscillator formula. Also, there are usually overbought and oversold thresholds, established based on his- torical observation. 492 Technical Market Indicators A market can only move in three directions: up, down, or sideways. It is com- mon knowledge among traders that most markets fluctuate within a trading range most of the time. More time is spent going sideways than trending higher or lower. In trading ranges, it pays to bet on reversals. In a trading range, price has a tendency to bounce from one extreme to an opposite extreme. The strategy that maximizes prof- its is ‘buy low, sell high.’ So the trader must sell near the high end of the trading range and buy near the lower end of the trading range. Oscillators are useful tools in identifying overbought and oversold extremes. Short-term, contratrend trading works fine as long as prices stay within the trad- ing range. If the price starts a powerful new trend, without advance notice, very large losses quickly accrue to those betting against the new trend. Weeks or months of small trading profits may be wiped out in days. New major trends are the most powerful and dynamic when they are new. After a prolonged trading range, traders are conditioned to think the trends do not last. However, in a dynamic new trend, oscillators quickly hit overbought or oversold, and remain there while prices continue to surge or plummet in the direction of the new trend. When divergences do appear, they merely signify a slowing of the initial ex- plosive velocity of a new trend. Oscillator traders continue to fade the trend, and their subsequent forced loss cutting feeds the continuation of the new trend. The oscillator mindset becomes a trap that will cause the trader to miss the bigger picture. Fighting a major trend based on some oscillator reading is a debilitating experience that has cost some leveraged traders everything. Oscillator trades contrary to a major trend can produce large equity drawdowns. A major trend is perceived only through long-term chart analysis. It is not pos- sible to see the big picture through the narrow lens of a short-term oscillator. Oscillators can be interpreted in a variety of ways. The following are some of the typical criteria for the interpretation of oscillators: • The oscillator and/or its own trailing moving average can be compared to certain high and low critical threshold levels, determined by observation of past oscillator behavior, to judge overbought and oversold levels. For exam- ple, overbought levels for RSI are typically defined as above 70, while oversold levels are typically below 30. This tends to work fine in a market confined to a sideways trading range, but it works very poorly when the market is in a powerful directional trend. • The relative levels of the oscillator are compared to the relative levels of the raw price data to determine any positive or negative divergences between the two. Keep in mind that Divergence Analysis can be subjective and re- quires experienced good judgement to apply correctly. • The oscillator is compared to a neutral threshold level, which is often zero or one or fifty, depending on how the data is manipulated by the indicator formula. Oscillators: Moving Average Oscillators Outside Day with an Outside Close 493 • The oscillator is compared to its own past trend, defined by its own moving average or trendline: above trend implies improving momentum while be- low trend implies deteriorating momentum. • The latest direction of both the oscillator and/or its moving average can be considered: rising generally implies improving momentum while falling generally implies deteriorating momentum. • The recent past trend of the oscillator may also be judged by its recent waves: a series of higher highs and higher lows would be bullish, while a series of lower highs and lower lows would be bearish. When one or more to these criteria are present, it can be taken as a partial signal to buy or sell, subordinate to major trend analysis. When the criteria are mixed, more subtle judgements may be called for. Since oscillators may tempt the user to trade against the prevailing trend, they can be dangerous in the hands of a novice. Oscilla- tors should be used only with confirmation by long-term trend technical analysis methods. For an example of an oscillator adapted to longer-term analysis, see Oscil- lators: Moving Average Oscillators, below. Outside Day with an Outside Close The outside day is characterized by the current day’s price range entirely enveloping the previous day’s range in both directions, that is, both a higher high and a lower low. Here, the closing price is also outside the previous day’s range, beyond the boundary of the previous day’s range. This pattern implies a volatile struggle where price pushes forcefully in one direction then the other, with the direction of the close pointing to the path of least resistance, and probable future trend. Therefore, on an outside day, buy a higher close, or short a lower close. Stops may be placed just be- yond the range. Buying and shorting outside days would have been an unprofitable trading strat- egy over 19-years of S&P 500 futures trading. The Equis International MetaStock® System Testing rules may be written as follows: Enter long: L<Ref(LLV(L,opt1),-1) AND C>Ref(HHV(H,opt1),-1) Close long: C<Ref(LLV(C,opt2),-1) Enter short: H>Ref(HHV(H,opt1),-1) AND C<Ref(LLV(L,opt1),-1) Close short: C>Ref(HHV(H,opt2),-1) 494 Technical Market Indicators Overbought/Oversold Oscillators Catching reversals of the minor trend in trading ranges or with the direction of the major trend can be profitable if the strategy is applied consistently and with perspec- tive. Buying at bottoms and selling at tops is always alluring to traders and investors alike. Consequently, many indicators have been devised to signal price extremes. Sto- chastics and RSI are two of the more popular examples. Overbought means significantly high readings on short-term oscillators, warn- ing of possible vulnerability to downward price correction. Oversold means significantly low readings on short-term oscillators, alerting to the potential for an upward price correction. Oscillators are most useful when the market is in a trading range. Also, oscilla- tors are useful for trading minor reactions in harmony with the direction of the major trend. Oscillators are dangerous if used for fading trending markets. This cannot be emphasized enough. It is hazardous to your wealth to take positions opposite to the major trend. A major trend is an overwhelmingly powerful force and must be re- spected. A major trend can overshoot all objectives that may seem reasonable. The ability of a market to register an overbought condition during a major up- trend is not a reason to fade that uptrend. Rather, the high oscillator reading should be taken as a positive sign of the vitality of the bullish trend. Similarly, the ability of a market to register an oversold condition during a ma- jor bearish trend is not a reason to buy. Rather, a low oscillator reading should be taken as a negative indication, a sign of the vitality of the bear. In a sideways or bearish major trend, the declining oscillator peaks and negative divergences on rallies usually indicate impending price weakness. In a sideways or bullish major trend, a pattern of rising oscillator lows and pos- itive divergences on price declines usually indicate impending price strength. Note that overbought/oversold indicators should be employed only in conjunc- tion with major trend analysis as an overriding filter. The direction of the major trend must be our major focus. If we lose this major trend focus, we are vulnerable to los- ing major dollars. Parabolic Time/Price System 495 Parabolic Time/Price System The Parabolic Time/Price System is a stop-setting entry and exit trading system de- scribed by J. Welles Wilder, Jr. (Wilder, Jr., J. W. (1978). New Concepts In Technical Trading Systems. McLeansville, NC: Trend Research). The system is designed to al- low some leeway or tolerance for contratrend price fluctuation early in a new trade. As time in the trade goes forward, the Parabolic Time/Price System progressively tightens a protective trailing stop order. To accomplish this, the system employs a series of progressively shorter, expo- nentially smoothed moving averages that follow the price trend. These averages change each period that price moves to a new extreme in the expected trend direction. The exponential smoothing constants, called Acceleration Factors, rise from an ini- tial minimum of 0.02, and then increase by 0.02 each day the price trend makes progress in the expected direction, up to a maximum Acceleration Factor of 0.20. This adaptive technique adjusts a trailing Stop and Reverse Price (SAR) pro- gressively closer to the actual current price. This SAR gives the new trend the most breathing room when the trend is new. Then as time goes on, the protective stop tight- ens. The Parabolic Time/Price System rides the trend until the SAR is penetrated, then the existing position is closed out, and the opposite position is opened. SAR calculations begin anew on each fresh SAR signal. For example, on the day of an initial buy signal, when a new long position is opened, the SAR is equal to the Extreme Price (EP), which is the lowest low recorded during the downward price movement that the Parabolic Time/Price System says has just ended. Thereafter, SAR is adjusted upward by an Acceleration Factor (AF) in the new expected trend direction. For new buy signals, the initial SAR is equal to the lowest price recorded dur- ing the just closed short position. On the second day, and thereafter, the SAR is ad- justed upward as follows: S P A (H P) where S the long-side sell Stop and Reverse Price (SAR) at which we reverse our current long position by selling long and selling short. P the previous period’s SAR. A an acceleration factor. A begins at .02 for the next period immediately after the initial SAR buy stop order opens the current long trade. The next period and each period thereafter, A is increased by .02 for each period that price rises to the highest high level (H) since the current long trade was opened. For periods when price does not set a new high within the current long trade time duration, A is left unchanged from its previous period’s level. H the highest high price since the current long trade was opened on a buy stop order. 496 Technical Market Indicators For new sell long and sell short signals, the initial SAR is equal to the highest price recorded during the just closed long position. On the second day, and thereafter, the SAR is adjusted downward as follows: S P A ( L P ) where S the short-side buy Stop and Reverse Price (SAR) at which we reverse our current short position by covering our outstanding short sale and buying a new long position. P the previous period’s SAR. A an acceleration factor. A begins at .02 for the next period immediately after the initial SAR sell stop order opens the current short-side trade. The next period and each period thereafter, A is increased by .02 for each period that price falls to the lowest low level (L) since the current short trade was opened. For periods when price does not set a new low within the current short trade time duration, A is left unchanged from its previous period’s level. L the lowest low price since the current short trade was opened on a sell stop order. On both sides of the market, long and short, the SAR must lie at or outside the latest two periods’ high to low price ranges. The SAR must never be inside the latest two periods’ price ranges. If it does fall within the latest two periods’ high to low price ranges, it must be reset: to the lower of the two most recent lows, for long posi- tions; to the higher of the two most recent highs, for short positions. The table on the facing page offers an example of the calculations involved in the Parabolic Time/Price System. Indicator Strategy Example for the Parabolic Time/Price System: Contrary SAR Our testing failed to uncover any effectiveness whatsoever for the Parabolic Time/Price System as originally described by Wilder. When an indicator loses money consistently, we can reverse the rules, buying when the indicator signals sell, and selling when the indicator signals buy. That worked, but the equity drawdowns were large. A long-term EMA filter can reduce drawdowns, but it also reduces total profit. The MetaStock® Indicator Builder syntax for our contrary version is: SAR(0.04,0.22). Based on daily data for the S&P 500 Stock Index Futures CSI Perpetual Con- tract (www.csidata.com) from 4/21/82 to 5/23/01, we found that trading contrarily to SAR signals, with an Acceleration Factor step size of 0.04 rising to a maximum of Parabolic Time/Price System 499 0.22, would have produced a positive result on a purely mechanical trend-fading sig- nal basis with no subjectivity, no sophisticated technical analysis, and no judgement: Enter Long (Buy) at the current daily price close of the S&P 500 Stock Index Futures Perpetual Contract when the daily high price is less than the SAR, with a SAR Acceleration Factor step size of 0.04 rising up to a max- imum of 0.22. Close Long (Sell) at the current daily price close of the S&P 500 Stock In- dex Futures Perpetual Contract when the daily low price is greater than the SAR, with a SAR Acceleration Factor step size of 0.04 rising up to a maximum of 0.22. Enter Short (Sell Short) at the current daily price close of the S&P 500 Stock Index Futures Perpetual Contract when the daily low price is greater than the SAR, with a SAR Acceleration Factor step size of 0.04 ris- ing up to a maximum of 0.22. Close Short (Cover) at the current daily price close of the S&P 500 Stock Index Futures Perpetual Contract when the daily high price is less than the SAR, with a SAR Acceleration Factor step size of 0.04 rising up to a max- imum of 0.22. Starting with $100 and reinvesting profits, total net profits for this contrary, trend-fading strategy would have been would have been $1,199.66, assuming a fully invested strategy, reinvestment of profits, no transactions costs and no taxes. This would have been 20.19 percent greater than buy-and-hold. Short selling would have been only slightly unprofitable, and short selling was included in the strategy. This contrary indicator would have given profitable buy signals 67.66% of the time. Trad- ing would have been active at one trade every 10.39 calendar days. The chart shows how going against the trend can cause severe equity draw- downs in trending markets. This Contrary SAR indicator works on balance because the stock market is choppy in the short-term most of the time.

We simply count the number of the stocks that are trading above their key moving averages, then divide that number by the total number of stocks ex- amined. The resulting percentage shows the proportion of stocks that can be consid- ered to be in uptrends. The indicator has been viewed as a momentum gauge with leading indicator characteristics, and it is also used to quantify overbought and over- sold general market conditions. And like other momentum indicators, the Percentage may peak or trough before tops and bottoms in the price indexes. Indicator Strategy Example for the Percentage of Stocks Above Their Own 30-Week Simple Moving Averages Historical data for this indicator shows that the Percentage of Stocks Above Their Own 30-Week Simple Moving Averages can be an effective indicator on both the long and short sides, and particularly on the long side. Based on the weekly Percent- age and the Dow-Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) for 33 years from January 1968 to January 2001, we found that the following parameters would have produced a signif- icantly positive result on a purely mechanical trend-following signal basis with no subjectivity, no sophisticated technical analysis, and no judgement: Enter Long (Buy) at the current weekly price close of the DJIA when the Percentage of Stocks Above Their Own 30-Week Simple Moving Aver- ages as of the previous week is less than its own trailing 35-week Expo- nential Moving Average as of the previous week, and the current Percentage Above Their Own 30-Week SMA is greater than its own trail- ing 2-week Exponential Moving Average as of the previous week. Close Long (Sell) at the current weekly price close of the DJIA when the Percentage of Stocks Above Their Own 30-Week Simple Moving Aver- ages as of the previous week is greater than its own trailing 17-week Ex- ponential Moving Average as of the previous week, and the current Percentage Above Their Own 30-Week SMA is less than its own trailing 41-week Exponential Moving Average as of the previous week. Enter Short (Sell Short) at the current weekly price close of the DJIA when the Percentage of Stocks Above Their Own 30-Week Simple Moving Averages as of the previous week is greater than its own trailing Percentage of Stocks Above Their Own 30-Week and 10-Week Simple Moving Averages 503 17-week Exponential Moving Average as of the previous week, and the current Percentage Above Their Own 30-Week SMA is less than its own trailing 41-week Exponential Moving Average as of the previous week. Close Short (Cover) at the current weekly price close of the DJIA when the Percentage of Stocks Above Their Own 30-Week Simple Moving Av- erages as of the previous week is less than its own trailing 35-week Expo- nential Moving Average as of the previous week, and the current Percentage Above Their Own 30-Week SMA is greater than its own trail- ing 2-week Exponential Moving Average as of the previous week. Starting with $100 and reinvesting profits, total net profits for this trend- following strategy would have been $5,548.81, assuming a fully invested strategy, reinvestment of profits, no transactions costs and no taxes. This would have been 467.45 percent better than buy-and-hold. Even short selling would have been prof- itable and was included in this strategy. The long-and-short strategy would have given profitable signals 54.30% of the time. Trading would have been relatively inactive at one trade every 68.65 calendar days.

We found that the following parameters would have produced a less posi- tive result on a purely mechanical trend-following signal basis with no subjectivity, no sophisticated technical analysis, and no judgement: Enter Long (Buy) at the current weekly price close of the DJIA when the Percentage of Stocks Above Their Own 10-Week Simple Moving Aver- ages as of the previous week is less than its own trailing 18-week Expo- nential Moving Average as of the previous week, and the current Percentage Above Their Own 10-Week SMA is greater than its own trail- ing 34-week Exponential Moving Average as of the previous week.

Enter Short (Sell Short) at the current weekly price close of the DJIA when the Percentage of Stocks Above Their Own 10-Week Simple Mov- ing Averages as of the previous week is greater than its own trailing 7-week Exponential Moving Average as of the previous week, and the cur- rent Percentage Above Their Own 10-Week SMA is less than its own trail- ing 34-week Exponential Moving Average as of the previous week.

Starting with $100 and reinvesting profits, total net profits for this trend- following strategy would have been $3,375.93, assuming a fully invested strategy, reinvestment of profits, no transactions costs and no taxes. This would have been 245.24 percent better than buy-and-hold. Even short selling slightly would have been profitable and was included in this strategy. The long-and-short strategy would have Percentage of Stocks Above Their Own 30-Week and 10-Week Simple Moving Averages 507 given profitable signals 52.05% of the time.

The indicator was intended to quantify the efficiency of price movement and how trendy or choppy the recent past price action has been. The article contains a highly elevated fog factor. The basic indicator at its core appears to be a highly complex variation of a price velocity oscillator, where a longer period change in the price close is divided by a shorter period average change in price. A companion article in the magazine offers the following MetaStock® Formula Language to express Polarized Fractal Efficiency: Mov(If(C,>,Ref(C,-9), Sqrt(Power(ROC(C,9,$), 2) Power(10,2)) / Sum(Sqrt(Power(ROC(C,1,$),2) 1),9), Sqrt(Power(ROC(C,9,$),2) Power(10,2)) / Sum(Sqrt(Power(ROC(C,1,$),2) 1),9))*100,5,E) where Mov(. . . ,5,E) the five-period exponential moving average. Sqrt square root of the expression that follows in parentheses. Power(ROC(C,9,$), 2) the 10-day change in the closing price squared. Power(10,2) 10 raised to a power of 2, or ten squared, or 100. ROC(C,9,$) the rate of change of the close over the past 10 periods expressed in dollars (that is, points, not percentages). Sum . . . 9 the sum over the trailing 9 periods of the expression that follows in parentheses. According to Hans Hannula, PFE readings above zero indicate that the trend has been up. The higher the PFE, the more efficient the upward movement. A straight-line price rise would be 100% efficient. Conversely, PFE readings below zero indicate that the trend has been down, and the lower the PFE the more efficient the downward movement. A straight-line price drop would be 100% efficient. Readings near zero indicate price congestion, choppy, trend-less, inefficient movement. Using the MetaStock® predefined formula, PFE(DATA ARRAY,PERIODS, SMOOTHING PERIODS), and default parameters of CLOSE price for the data array, ten for the periods, and five for the smoothing, it appears that the S&P 500 futures CSI Perpetual Contract seldom trend efficiently. Moreover, it would appear that the ranges of the indicator have become more extreme in recent years. So, this indicator might benefit from being preprocessed and statistically normalized to compensate for changes in volatility. Moreover, it seems possible that the outputs may be inconsistent with the author’s apparent stated intent. Therefore, caution is warranted when view- ing this indicator. 522 Technical Market Indicators Positive Volume Index (PVI) The Positive Volume Index (PVI), created by Paul Dysart, cumulates net price change fractional ratios for periods of increasing volume only. The volume itself is used only as a qualifier to determine whether or not to include the day’s net price change frac- tional ratio in the cumulative total. Most often, PVI is defined as a cumulative total of daily price change ratios on rising volume days only. Also, PVI can be calculated for any other time interval, such as minutes, hourly, weekly, and monthly. Moreover, PVI can be calculated using any market index, stock or commodity, as long as there is data for closing price and volume. The PVI is calculated in six simple steps: 1. Subtract the previous day’s volume from today’s volume, respecting sign. 2. If the Step 1 subtraction results in a positive number, then the current day’s volume is greater than the previous day’s volume. That is defined as a posi- tive volume day. 3. If the Step 1 subtraction results in a negative number, then the current day’s volume is less than the previous day’s volume. That is defined as a negative volume day. 4. If it is a positive volume day then calculate the day’s price change fraction by dividing the current day’s price gain (assigned a plus sign) or the current day’s price loss (assigned a minus sign) by the closing price of the previous day. Respect the sign. 5. If it is a negative volume day then the current day’s price change fraction is set to zero. 6. Add the number found in Step 4 or Step 5 to a cumulative total. In the MetaStock® Indicator Builder dialogue, PVI may be written: Cum(If(V>Ref(V,-1),ROC(C,1,%),0)) The literal translation is: ‘Cumulate the following: If the current volume ‘V’ is greater than the previous period’s volume ‘Ref(V,-1)’, then compute the Rate- of-Change ‘ROC’ of the Closing price ‘C’ for one period expressed as a percentage; otherwise (if the current volume is less than the previous volume), set the day’s Rate- of-Change of the Closing price computation to zero before cumulating.’ Norman Fosback (The Institute for Econometric Research, 3471 North Federal Highway, Forth Lauderdale, FL 33306) found that when PVI was above its own trail- ing 1-year moving average, it effectively indicated a bull market for stocks. Our in- dependent testing confirmed Fosback’s results. We also found that when PVI was below its own trailing 1-year moving aver- age, it paid to be out of the stock market. A negative PVI trend signaled a huge loss Presidential Election Cycle 531 Indicator Strategy Example for the Presidential Election Cycle A strategy of buying stocks about two years before then selling just after the Presi- dential Election was suggested by David MacNeill in an edition of the Stock Traders Almanac, Old Tappan, NJ: Hirsch Organization, www.stocktradersalmanac.com. Historical data shows that this Presidential Election Cycle strategy would have been quite accurate on the long side over the past 68 years. The only losing trades would have between the end of 1938 and the end of 1940, a time of unusual volatil- ity due to war news. Based on the year-end closing prices for the DJIA for 68 years from the end of 1932 to the end of 2000, we found that the following parameters would have produced a positive result on a purely mechanical trend-following signal basis with no subjectivity, no sophisticated technical analysis, and no judgement: Enter Long (Buy) at the year-end price close of the DJIA nearly 22 months before the Presidential Election. Close Long (Sell) at the year-end price close of the DJIA nearly two months after the Presidential Election. Enter Short (Sell Short) never. Starting with $100 and reinvesting profits, total net profits for this Presidential Election Cycle strategy would have been $3688.03, assuming a fully invested strat- egy, reinvestment of profits, no transactions costs and no taxes. This would have been 73.63 percent less than buy-and-hold, but the strategy was exposed to market risk only half of the time. No allowance was made for any return on capital when out of the market after a sell signal. Only one of 17 signals would have been a loser, so 94.12% would have been winning trades. Short selling, which was not included in this strategy, would have lost money. This is a very simple strategy, and there is prob- ably plenty of room for performance enhancement with the addition of more sophis- ticated filter rules.

This wheel has been reinvented several times, each time with great enthusiasm, and all these are different names for the same thing. The idea is simple: buy when the price rises up above previous highs, and sell when the price falls below previous lows. The only parameter to consider is the time length of the look-back period. It is pure trend-following. These Price Channel lines extend horizontally from price highs and lows into the future, out to the right on the chart. (See Trend Channel for a discussion of slop- ing Price Channel lines.) Indicator Strategy Example for Price Channel Our testing confirms that Price Channel can be an effective indicator. MetaStock® software executes all trades on the close and, therefore, Price Channel works better examining close-only data. Based on an 18.5-year file of S&P futures CSI Perpetual Contract (www.csidata.com) from April 21, 1982, to November 17, 2000, we found that the following parameters would have produced a positive result on a purely me- chanical trend-following signal basis with no subjectivity, no sophisticated technical analysis, and no judgement: Enter Long (Buy) at the current daily price close of the S&P 500 futures CSI Perpetual Contract when the close is greater than the close the previ- ous period. Close Long (Sell) at the current daily price close of the S&P 500 futures CSI Perpetual Contract when the close is less than any close over the pre- vious 100 periods.

Kaufman (Kaufman, P. (1987). The New Commodity Trading Systems and Methods. New York: John Wiley & Sons. Page 213). For example, the number of days in the look-back period can be varied by multiplying the long-term historical optimal length by a ratio of long-term historical price volatility to recent price volatility. By placing recent volatility in the denominator of the fractional multiplier, as volatility rises, the multiplier declines, thus producing a smaller value for the look-back period, making the decision rule more sensitive, and speeding the response time when the market is volatile and on the move. Conversely, as volatility declines, the multiplier rises, thus producing a larger value for the look-back period, making the decision rule less sensitive, and slowing response time when the market is dull and quiet with low volatility. Price Oscillators: Moving Average Oscillators Moving average oscillators are most usefully set up as a percentage difference be- tween a shorter and a longer moving average. Moving averages are widely used to smooth out raw market data. They tame at least some of the erratic short-term fluctu- ation that typically creates confusion. All technical analysis computer software should be able to plot the percentage difference, ratio, or point difference between any two moving averages. Thoughtful technicians greatly prefer percentage difference or the ratio representations because these automatically adjust over time to large differences in price levels. For example, when the DJIA was at 1000, a 100-point price move was 10%, but when the DJIA was 10,000, a 100-point price swing was only 1%. While a point difference would show both movements as being of equal magnitude, a percentage difference (or ratio) more accurately portrays the comparative significance of each price movement. For fine tuning a moving average oscillator, there are two parameters to be op- timized: the time length, n, of a shorter moving average and the time length, p, of a longer one. When the percentage difference (or point difference) between the two moving averages crosses zero, a trend change, and thus a trade position change, is sig- naled in the direction of the crossing. (When the ratio of two moving averages crosses 1.00, that is exactly the same as the difference crossing zero.) The number of observations (minutes, days, weeks, months) that should be in- cluded in a moving average designed to identify a trend depends on the length of the cyclical movements in the underlying raw time series data. Optimal values can deter- mined by simple ‘brute force’, a systematic trial-and-error procedure testing various combinations of lengths. For example, if we allow each length to range from 1 to 100 Price Oscillators: Moving Average Oscillators 539 days, there would be 10,000 (100 x 100) combinations of two moving averages. That would take time to run on some computers, but we do not need to test every possible combination of averages. In actual practice, to make this task more manageable and faster, we would first approach it with broad-scan testing using large increments be- tween tested variables. In our example, if we allow two moving averages to range be- tween 5 to 100 days in increments of 5 days, we cut the number of combinations to 400 (20 x 20), a 96% reduction. This task can be completed in minutes. After that broad first pass, we can decrease both the increment and the range, focusing in on the most promising parameters for fine tuning. The popularly followed relationship between the closing price and any moving average can also be displayed as an oscillator. The calculations are even simpler than a two moving average oscillator, since a moving average with a period length of one is simply the closing price itself. For example, using the popular 40-week (200-day) moving average, subtract the 40-week moving average of Friday’s closing prices from the latest Friday’s closing price. Then, divide that difference by the 40-week moving average, and multiply by 100 to convert from decimals to percentages. When the resulting oscillator crosses above zero, the closing price moves above its own 40-week moving average, and that is interpreted as a buy signal. Conversely, when the closing price moves below its own 40-week moving average, the oscillator crosses below zero, and that is taken as a signal to close out long positions by selling. There are three advantages to viewing moving average crossovers as percentage difference oscillators moving above and below zero: 1. 2. We can often see crossings more clearly. We can better anticipate crossings. 3. We can subjectively interpret momentum divergences from an oscillator chart. Such divergences may not be detected on a price with moving average chart without the oscillator. Indicator Strategy Example for the Price Oscillator, Percentage Difference of Two Moving Averages A Price Oscillator can be interpreted many ways, but the simplest way is pure trend following. Based on a 101-year file of weekly data for the DJIA from 1/2/1900 to 12/29/00, we found that the following parameters would have produced a positive re- sult on a purely mechanical signal basis with no subjectivity, no sophisticated techni- cal analysis, and no judgement: Enter Long (Buy) when the 1/40 oscillator turns positive; that is, buy at the current weekly price close of the DJIA when that closing price divided 542 Technical Market Indicators by its own trailing 40-week EMA crosses above one, which also means that the percentage price oscillator crosses above zero. Close Long (Sell) when the 1/40 oscillator turns negative; that is, sell at the current weekly price close of the DJIA when that closing price divided by its own trailing 40-week EMA crosses below one, which also means that the percentage price oscillator crosses below zero. Enter Short (Sell Short) never. Starting with $100 and reinvesting profits, total net profits for this trend- following strategy would have been $97,517.16, assuming a fully invested strategy, reinvestment of profits, no transactions costs and no taxes. This would have been 331.86 percent greater than buy-and-hold. Short selling would have been not prof- itable, and short selling was not included in the strategy. This Price Oscillator long- only strategy would have given profitable buy signals only 29.94% of the time. Note that this trend-following strategy, though wrong on most of its trades, would have en- joyed much bigger average gains than average losses. There would have been some equity drawdowns, but they appear to have been controlled. Trading would have been relatively inactive at one trade every 208.34 calendar days, on average.

In an uptrend, draw a straight trendline sloping upward through the most recent obvious pivot-point lows for a lower channel line and support line where we look to buy. Next, draw a parallel straight line through the an intervening price high point for an upper channel line, resistance line, and upside price swing target where we look to sell, to take profits on the long side. In a downtrend, draw a straight trendline sloping downward through the most recent obvious pivot-point highs for an upper channel line and resistance line where we look to sell short. Next, draw a parallel straight line through the an intervening price low point for a lower channel line, support line, and downside price swing tar- get where we look to buy to cover short, to take profits on the short side. Price often finds resistance and support at these parallel channel lines. In the case of a shortfall of a channel line, the prevailing trend may be losing momentum, losing power. In the case of overshoot of a channel line, the trend may be accelerat- ing or growing more volatile. Channels also can be projected mathematically, without the use of traditional charting methods, through the use of bands around moving averages or regression lines. Such bands are the basic line plus and minus fixed percentages or adaptive quantities based on trailing standard deviations or multiples of Average True Range. (See Bollinger Bands and Envelopes.) Program Trading Volume Program trading buying and selling volume reflects certain professional trading strategies, including stock index futures arbitrage against a basket of underlying stocks. Basically, when futures become cheap compared to the underlying stocks, buy futures and simultaneously sell stocks. When futures become expensive compared to the underlying stocks, buy stocks and simultaneously sell futures. Traders use some- times complex variations of the Black-Scholes Options Pricing Model to determine what is expensive and cheap. Ned Davis Research found that when the ratio of smoothed buy program trad- ing volume divided by total program trading volume rises above 104.2, it is bullish for stocks. Conversely, when the ratio falls below 97, it is bearish. This strategy out- performed the market over the period shown on the chart. Projection Bands 545 Projection Bands Projection Bands were originally introduced by Mel Widner in the July 1995 issue of Technical Analysis of Stocks & Commodities magazine (www.traders.com). These bands are conceptually similar to several better-known tools used to help identify trading range boundaries, such Price Channels, Envelopes, and Bollinger Bands. Projection Bands are derived by first finding a linear regression line fitted through the closes over the past n-period look-back window. Then, two lines are drawn parallel to this linear regression line: one plotted though the lows and another plotted through the highs of the n-period look-back window. The relevant window moves forward every day such that the price is always contained within these mini- mum and maximum price boundaries. The interpretation is simple: when price is at the upper band, it could be consid- ered to be on resistance and overbought; when price is at the lower band, it could be considered to be oversold and on support. Projection Bands are designed to help a trader buy low and sell high. They work best in a sideways, trading range market. During strongly trending markets, however, overbought/oversold indicators can go very wrong, as the trend overwhelms all resis- tance and support and price continues in the trend direction much farther than most traders expect. Indicator Strategy Example for Projection Bands Projection Bands require experience and judgement to use as Mel Widner intended. Even naïve testing assumptions suggest that Projection Bands may have some objec- tive potential value as a purely mechanical, contra-trend technical indicator. The ma- jority of oversold buy signals would have been profitable. Moreover, these buy signals would have been robust, with all lookback period lengths from 1 to 50 days profitable and right most of the time, for long trades only. Short lengths under 11-days would have been only slightly profitable. As attractive as a high percentage of profitable trades may seem, however, it is important to note that this and other contra-trend overbought/oversold strategies failed to provide any protection in the Crash of ’87. As the chart shows, there can be sharp equity drawdowns. Using Projection Bands for contra-trend oversold and over- bought signals would have been a profitable strategy for long trades only. Short sell- ing would not have been profitable in the past. Based on a 18-year file of daily data for the entire history of the S&P 500 Composite Stock Price Index Futures from 4/21/82 to 12/22/00 (using CSI Perpetual Contract data collected from www.csidata.com), we found that the following parameters would have produced a positive result on a purely mechanical over- bought/oversold signal basis with no subjectivity, no sophisticated technical analysis, and no judgement: Projection Oscillators 549 Enter Long (Buy) at the current daily price close of the S&P 500 Com- posite Stock Price Index futures CSI Perpetual Contract when the daily low is equal to the 22 day look-back period Projection Band Bottom (Low). Close Long (Sell) at the current daily price close of the S&P 500 Com- posite Stock Price Index futures CSI Perpetual Contract when the daily high is equal to the 22 day look-back period Projection Band Top (High). Enter Short (Sell Short) never. Starting with $100 and reinvesting profits, total net profits for this Projection Bands counter-trend strategy would have been $801.50, assuming a fully invested strategy, reinvestment of profits, no transactions costs and no taxes. This would have been 21.99 percent less than buy-and-hold. No short selling would have been prof- itable, and no short selling was included in the strategy. Short selling would have cut the profit further. The long-only Projection Bands as an indicator would have given profitable buy signals 77.24% of the time. Trading would have been only moderately active at one trade every 35.90 calendar days. Note that this strategy executes trades at closing prices only. The Equis International MetaStock® System Testing rules are written: Enter long: LOW ProjBandBot(opt1) Close long: HIGH ProjBandTop(opt1) Enter short: HIGH ProjBandTop(opt1) Close short: LOW ProjBandBot(opt1) OPT1 Current value: 22 Projection Oscillator The Projection Oscillator was originally introduced by Mel Widner in the July 1995 issue of Technical Analysis of Stocks & Commodities magazine (www.traders.com). It is based on Projection Bands. It gives the location of the current close within the top and bottom bands, stated as a percentage of the current high-band minus low-band range. That percentage is smoothed with a 3-day EMA. The Projection Oscillator is conceptually somewhat similar to the better-known Stochastic, and it is interpreted in a similar manner. The simplest way to use the Projection Oscillator is for overbought/oversold signals: buy when the oscillator falls below 30; sell when the oscillator rises above 70. The general idea is that high levels indicate excessive, unsustainable optimism, 550 Technical Market Indicators while low levels indicate excessive unsustainable pessimism. That works fine in a market confined to a sideways trading range, but it works very poorly when the mar- ket is in a powerful directional trend. Like other oscillators, the Projection Oscillator may be used for Divergence Analysis. Here we consider selling when prices are making higher highs while the os- cillator fails to surpass its own previous highs. We consider buying when prices are making lower lows while the oscillator fails to break its own previous lows. Keep in mind that Divergence Analysis is subjective and requires experienced good judge- ment to apply correctly. Since it may tempt the user to trade against the prevailing trend, it can be dangerous in the hands of a novice. Indicator Strategy Example for Projection Oscillator The Projection Oscillator requires experience and judgement to use as Mel Widner in- tended. Even naïve testing assumptions suggest that the Projection Oscillator may have some objective potential value as a purely mechanical, contra-trend technical in- dicator. The majority of oversold buy signals would have been profitable. Moreover, these buy signals would have been robust, with all lookback period lengths from 1 to 50 days profitable and right most of the time, for long trades only.

As the chart shows, there can be sharp equity drawdowns. Using the Projection Oscillator for contra-trend oversold and overbought signals would have been a profitable strategy for long trades only.

This would have been 16.57 percent greater than buy-and-hold. No short selling would have been profitable, and no short selling was included in the strategy.

The algorithm or formula need to calculate the result is not divulged. The quite understandable business reason for such non-disclosure is to preserve the uniqueness of the analysis, to prevent wide- spread imitation, and to maintain trade secrets. Unfortunately for the user, such secrecy also prevents understanding and devel- oping confidence in the indicator output. If a trader cannot understand exactly what a proprietary indicator is saying and why, then he is likely to abandon all discipline based on such a proprietary indicator after a few losing signals. Although strings of losing signals are common to most indicators, good indicators overcome this problem if the trader sticks with the discipline of following every signal. Also, if the underlying assumptions on which a proprietary indicator relies should be changed by some powerful external development, the user would not be equipped to notice before substantial losses are incurred. Furthermore, relying on a proprietary indicator does not contribute to intellec- tual development, enhanced trading skills or growth of wisdom of its user. For these reasons, most thoughtful technicians avoid all proprietary indicators. There are, after all, many interesting and useful concepts to explore that are fully available for thorough analysis. And, no matter if an indicator is accepted or rejected, a thorough study of an indicator’s construction and past performance can offer bene- ficial insights into the nature of market movements, making the student a better tech- nical analyst. R-squared 579 R-squared R-squared attempts to quantify the propensity of prices to trend in the established di- rection. The more closely prices move in a linear relationship with the passing of time, the stronger the trend has been, and the higher the r-squared. When r-squared is above its critical value and heading up, then it is said that we may be 95% confident that a strong trend has been present. The following table shows the critical values of r-squared required for a 95% confidence level at various time periods. If the r-squared value is equal to or greater than the critical values shown, prices have shown a statistically significant trend. But if the r-squared value is less than the critical values shown, prices have shown no sta- tistically significant trend. Number r-squared of Periods Critical Value (95% confidence level) 5 0.77 10 14 20 25 30 50 60 0.40 0.27 0.20 0.16 0.13 0.08 0.06 120 0.03 R-squared is commonly used with Linear Regression Slope. When critical r-squared values are accompanied by a positive Linear Regression Slope value, that is taken as a significant signal. Indeed, by adding a requirement of r-squared greater than 0.03, profitability of the 245-day Linear Regression Slope was enhanced slightly. See Linear Regression Slope. Indicator Strategy Example for r-squared with Linear Regression Slope R-squared combined with Linear Regression Slope is robust. We required r-squared critical values of 0.03 or greater combined Linear Regression Slope period lengths between 120 and 320 days. All would have been profitable for long trades only. No short selling strategy was profitable. Based on an 18-year file of daily data for the entire history of the S&P 500 Composite Stock Price Index futures CSI Perpetual Contract, collected from www.csidata.com, from 4/21/82 to 12/22/00, we found that the following parameters 582 Technical Market Indicators would have produced a positive result on a purely mechanical signal basis with no subjectivity, no sophisticated technical analysis, and no judgement: Enter Long (Buy) at the current daily price close of the S&P 500 Com- posite Stock Price Index futures CSI Perpetual Contract when the 245-day Linear Regression Slope is greater than zero and r-squared is equal to or greater than 0.03, indicating a significant price uptrend.

Enter Short (Sell Short) never. Starting with $100 and reinvesting profits, total net profits for this r-squared combined with Linear Regression Slope trend-following strategy would have been $544.48, assuming a fully invested strategy, reinvestment of profits, no transactions costs and no taxes. This would have been 47.00 percent less than buy-and-hold. No short selling would have been profitable, and no short selling was included in the strategy. This long-only r-squared combined with Linear Regression Slope variation would have given profitable buy signals 100% of the time, though the sample size of only five trades is not significant. Trading would have been inactive at one trade every 1364.20 calendar days.

The future movements of markets cannot be predicted by any method whatso- ever. Both technical and fundamental analysis have no validity. An intelligent analyst with the best education, information and insight would still have no chance of earn- ing extraordinary returns in the market. Active investors who have become enor- mously wealthy from their investments are mere statistical flukes. Ten thousand monkeys playing the investment game would produce similar proportions of winners Random Walk Index (RWI) 583 and losers. Any evidence of anomalies contradicting the Random Walk Hypothesis are merely data or programming errors. There never has been any actual evidence or proof to support the Random Walk Hypothesis, and its popularity is steadily fading. More academics are arguing that there is actual evidence of anomalies (non-random, inefficient stock price move- ment), that markets may be predictable to at least some degree, and even that efficient markets are an impossibility. It is impossible to find a successful investor or trader who has any time for the Random Walk Hypothesis. Many simple and objective technical market indicators in- cluded in this book beat a passive buy-and-hold strategy very substantially on an ab- solute basis and particularly on a risk-adjusted basis. These impressive results would not be possible if the market were largely efficient or random. Random Walk Index (RWI) The Random Walk Index (RWI) is both a short-term overbought/oversold trend fad- ing indicator and a long-term trend following indicator. RWI was introduced by E. Michael Poulos, ‘Of Trends And Random Walks’, Technical Analysis of Stocks & Commodities, V. 9:2 pages 49-52, www.traders.com. The indicator identifies the max- imum RWI value over the past n-days, separately for lows and highs, and separately for short term and long term. RWI computes the difference between today’s low and the high n-days ago, and that difference is divided by the Average True Range for the most recent past n days multiplied by the square root of the number of days, including today. By multiplying the divisor by the square root of the number of days, the indicator gives progressively less weight to the older data. For example, first compare today’s low to yesterday’s high, then divide that by the product of the two days’ Average True Range multiplied by the square root of 2. Second, compare today’s low to the high two days ago, then divide that by the Aver- age True Range for the past three days’ average range multiplied by the square root of 3. Third, compare today’s low to the high three days ago, then divide that by the Av- erage True Range for the past four days’ average range multiplied by the square root of 4. And so on. This process is carried out to an n-day lookback period. The largest value of RWI for the series of lookback lengths from one through n-periods is recorded. If any of these lookback lengths generate a value of greater than one, then the market is trending (lower in this example). Also, RWI computes the difference between today’s high and the low n-days ago, and that difference also is divided by the Average True Range for the most recent past n days multiplied by the square root of the number of days, including today. 584 Technical Market Indicators The same process is repeated, subtracting each of the previous n-days’ lows from today’s high, then that difference is divided by these past days’ Average True Range multiplied by the square root of the number of days being measured, including today. Fortunately, all of this calculating is done effortlessly with the preprogrammed indicator on the Metastock® software indicator menu. RWI uses separate indicators for the short-term and the long term. SRWI is a short-term, 2- to 7-day RWI used for short-term overbought/oversold trend fading. SRWI above 1.0 is unsustainable. Peaks in the SRWI of highs coincide with short- term price peaks. Peaks in the SRWI of lows coincide with short-term price lows. LRWI is a longer-term, 8- to 64-day RWI used for long-term trend following. LRWI of highs greater than 1.0 indicates a longer-term, sustainable uptrend. LRWI of lows greater than 1.0 indicates a longer-term, sustainable downtrend. The author suggests that an effective trading system might be built that opens trades after short-term corrections against the direction of the long-term trend: close short and enter long when the long-term RWI of the highs is greater than 1.0 and the short-term RWI of lows peaks above 1.0; close long and enter short when the long-term RWI of the lows is greater than 1.0 and the short-term RWI of highs peaks above 1.0.

Upshaw, CMT, (465 Hillcrest East, Lake Quivira, KS 66106), devised a simple way to make price range projections for a market. Using only the yearly high and low for the Dow-Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), divide the annual price low by the annual price high. Next, multiply that ratio by 100, to convert it to a percentage. Calculate a 20-year simple moving average of that percentage ratio. Compute the standard deviation; that is, the 20 percentage ratios (one for each year) minus their 20- year average, square these differences, divide by the number of observations (in this case 20), then take the square root. Most of the time, the annual price range in any year will be within one standard deviation of the average price range of the past 20 years. The following is the custom formula for Upshaw’s ‘Home On The Range’ Price Projection Method in MetaStock® Formula Language: Mov((((L/H)*100)),20,S); Stdev((L/H)*100,20) Where Mov is Moving Average, L is Low for the year, H is High for the year, 20 is the number of years in the moving average, S is the symbol for Simple Moving Aver- age, and Stdev is the Standard Deviation, again over 20 years. This formula returns all the information we need for Upshaw’s HOTR. It tells us that over the 20 years from 1980 through 2000, the low of the DJIA as a percentage of the high has averaged 79.6%. The standard deviation over the same period has been 6.2 percentage points. These numbers were fairly stable for 42 years, 1958 through 2000. The same formula can be applied to any time period or any financial instrument. For example, substitute 99 years for 20 years in the formula, and we find that over 99 years, from 1901 to 2000, the low of the DJIA as a percentage of the high has aver- aged 76.3%. The standard deviation over the same period has been 10.4 percentage points. The wider range and higher standard deviation reflect the greater volatility the market exhibited in the 1920’s and 1930’s. These formulas might seem to offer a readily workable rough guideline for pro- jecting a price range. Once a year’s high or low seems likely to have been established, it becomes a simple statistical exercise to project the opposite extreme of the range— just plug the numbers into the formula. We might modify Upshaw’s formula to look at annual rates-of-change of year- end closing prices, a popular pastime among forecasters. We would divide the last price of the year by the closing price one year earlier. Next, multiply that ratio frac- tion by 100, to convert it to a percentage. Calculate an n-period simple moving aver- age of this percentage. Compute the standard deviation. Again, most of the time, the 590 Technical Market Indicators annual price change is within one standard deviation of the average price change of the past n-periods. The following is the custom formula using closing prices only in MetaStock® Formula Language: Periods: Input(‘Enter the number of periods’,1,999,10); ((C/Ref(C,-1))*100)-100; Mov((((C/Ref(C,-1))*100)-100),Periods,S); Stdev(((C/Ref(C,-1))*100),Periods); Where Periods is the number of periods you choose for the calculation, Periods are al- lowed to vary from one period to 999 periods (with a default value set at ten periods, since 10 years is an industry standard in performance measurement), C is the closing price, and Ref(C,-1) is the previous period’s closing price. The DJIA’s rolling 10-year average annual rate of price appreciation was 16% from 1997 through 2000, an extreme level seen only once before, in 1928. That 16% growth rate was double the 99-year average of 8%. In other words, price performance was 100% above average. The rolling 10-year standard deviation hovered around 12 percentage points from 1991 to 2000, well below the historical 89-year average of 20 and at the low end of the historical range of 38 to 10 percentage points. In other words, volatility was 40% below average. So, the formula says that over the past century, the DJIA has gone up 8% a year on average, with a normal range of 12% to 28%, representing one standard devi- ation of 20 percentage points, based on 100-years of history. This kind of simple observation is commonly mistaken for a forecast that may seem to be statistically reasonable but actually is completely naïve. Reality is a great deal more complex than a simple formula. Multiple cycles spanning a variety of time frames are continuously converging and diverging in non-linear combinations, de- feating straight-line projections. Investors would be better served by technical indi- cators that do not even attempt to make forecasts, but rather effectively track trends to give timely signals of trend change that we can act upon to maximize our profits and minimize our losses. The Range Indicator (TRI) The Range Indicator (TRI) is designed to take advantage of an expanding normalized price range within an established long-term trend. TRI was introduced by Jack L. Weinberg in the June 1995 issue of Technical Analysis of Stocks & Commodities magazine, V13:6 (www.traders.com). TRI is based on a somewhat complex formula, 592 Technical Market Indicators with if/then contingencies. Fortunately, the formula is a predefined function on the MetaStock® indicator menu. At its core, TRI is nothing more than a volatility mea- sure, specifically, a normalized Average True Range. Used with a trend/momentum indicator, as Weinberg suggests, TRI jumps on accelerating short-term price volatil- ity within a larger time-frame trend. TRI is based on the basic observation that a large expansion in the average size of the daily high-low price range indicates the end of a trading range and the start of a new price trend in a market. Small daily price ranges often coincide with a dull, trend-less, trading-range bound, sideways price drift. On the other hand, a significant expansion in the daily price ranges often coincides with a new and dynamic direc- tional price trend. TRI may be expressed as follows: R the current day’s True Range divided by the difference of the current closing price minus the previous day’s closing price. T the True Range for the current day. L the lowest value of either T or R over the past n days. H the highest value of either T or R over the past n days. C current closing price. P the previous day’s closing price. n the number of days in the calculation period. x the number of days in exponential moving average smoothing. 1. If C>P, then compute T/(C-P). That is, if the current closing price is greater than the previous day’s closing price, then divide the current day’s True Range by the current closing price minus the previous day’s closing price. 2. If C<P, then calculate T. That is, if the current closing price is less than the previous day’s closing price, then calculate the current day’s True Range. 3. If the highest value of either Step 1 or Step 2 over the past n days is greater than the lowest value of either Step 1 or Step 2 over the past n days, then subtract the lowest value (L) from the value of either Step 1 or Step 2, whichever applies. 4. Divide the difference in Step 3 by H-L, that is, divide by the difference of H minus L. 5. 6. Multiply the ratio from Step 4 by 100. Smooth the value from Step 5 with an x-day exponential moving average. Weinberg suggested interpreting TRI together with the use of an independent in- dicator of price trend, such as moving average crossover. Signals are taken when TRI crosses above and below certain arbitrarily defined levels. Those levels would depend on the volatility of each particular market being analyzed. The problem with that is The Range Indicator (TRI) 593 that the number of combinations of parameters, fitted to each particular market, and allowing n and x to vary, could be staggering, making working with this indicator time consuming and complex. Moreover, we observed that the appropriate levels for TRI might drift over time, such that the user might have to adjust parameters fre- quently. A more adaptive approach might be to apply Moving Averages, Envelopes or Bollinger Bands to TRI to define signal thresholds. We used the simplest form, TRI above and below a trailing exponential moving average of itself, for signal generation in our Indicator Strategy Example, below. In his published example, Weinberg used three days to compute the both of Av- erage True Range and the Rate of Change of closing price. Weinberg used 10 days for an exponential moving average smoothing. Again, Weinberg noted that the actual ap- propriate number of days for basic measuring and smoothing would depend on the volatility of each particular market being analyzed. In the predefined MetaStock® version of Range Indicator, default values are set to 10 periods for computing the normalized Average True Range and 10 days for ex- ponential moving average smoothing. For the S&P futures, these default values ap- pear to work better than the 3 periods Average True Range and 10-day smoothing used in Weinberg’s example. Indicator Strategy Example for the Range Indicator A simplified version of The Range Indicator would have outperformed a simple trend-following indicator while cutting the number of losing trades in half. Based on an 18-year file of daily data for the entire history of the S&P 500 Composite Stock Price Index futures CSI Perpetual Contract, collected from www.csidata.com, from 4/21/82 to 12/22/00, we found that the following parameters would have produced a positive result on a purely mechanical signal basis with no subjectivity, no sophisti- cated technical analysis, and no judgement: Enter Long (Buy) at the current daily price close of the S&P 500 Com- posite Stock Price Index futures CSI Perpetual Contract when it closes above its own previous day’s 271-day trailing Exponential Moving Aver- age of the closing prices and The Range Indicator (set to the MetaStock® default values of 10 periods and 10-day Exponential Smoothing) is above its previous day’s 4-day trailing Exponential Moving Average of the TRI itself, thus indicating an expanding normalized price range. Close Long (Sell) at the current daily price close of the S&P 500 Com- posite Stock Price Index futures CSI Perpetual Contract when it closes be- low its own previous day’s 271-day trailing Exponential Moving Average of the closing prices and The Range Indicator (set to the MetaStock® de- fault values of 10 periods and 10-day Exponential Smoothing) is above its 596 Technical Market Indicators previous day’s 4-day trailing Exponential Moving Average of the TRI it- self, thus indicating an expanding normalized price range. Enter Short (Sell Short) never. Starting with $100 and reinvesting profits, total net profits for the Range Indi- cator strategy would have been $515.60, assuming a fully invested strategy, reinvest- ment of profits, no transactions costs and no taxes. This would have been 49.82 percent less than buy-and-hold. No short selling would have been profitable, and no short selling was included in the strategy. This long-only Range Indicator strategy would have given profitable buy signals 33.33% of the time. Trading would have been relatively inactive at one trade every 284.21 calendar days. The Equis International MetaStock® System Testing rules are written as follows: Enter long: CLOSE > Ref(Mov(CLOSE,opt1,E),-1) AND RangeIndicator(opt2,opt3)> Ref(Mov(RangeIndicator(opt2,opt3),opt4,E),-1) Close long: CLOSE < Ref(Mov(CLOSE,opt1,E),-1) AND RangeIndicator(opt2,opt3)> Ref(Mov(RangeIndicator(opt2,opt3),opt4,E),-1) OPT1 Current value: 271 OPT2 Current value: 10 OPT3 Current value: 10 OPT4 Current value: 4 Rate of Change (ROC) Rate of Change is a common expression of price velocity, or ‘momentum’. Gener- ally, ROC is computed by dividing the current price by the price n-periods ago. For example, if the current price is 100 and the price 18-weeks ago was 80, then the 18-week Rate of Change is 100/80 or 1.25. Next, technicians commonly subtract 1.00 and multiply by 100 to change the scaling to percentage points of price change over the time interval selected. (Momentum is sometimes expressed as the current price minus the price n-weeks ago, but that creates problems with comparable scaling over time as price levels change.) Commonly, when the percentage Rate of Change is greater than zero, that is taken as a signal that price velocity exhibits positive trend momentum and that is bull- ish. The point at which Rate of Change crosses above zero is taken as a buy signal. But when Rate of Change crosses below zero, that is a sell signal, and it means trend momentum has turned bearish. Rate of Change (ROC) 597 The major problem with Rate of Change is that it jumps around erratically. It is as dependent on the old, obsolete data dropping off the moving n-period calculation window as it is sensitive to fresh data coming in. A large change in the market n-periods ago will cause the ROC to jump wildly even if the current market is un- changed. This is a big mistake. ROC produces more than its fair share of bad signals and is not recommended as a technical indicator. There are much better indicators to choose from. Indicator Strategy Example for ROC Based on a 101-year file of weekly data for the DJIA from January 1900 to Decem- ber 2000, we found that the following parameters would have produced a positive re- sult on a purely mechanical trend-following signal basis with no subjectivity, no sophisticated technical analysis, and no judgement: Enter Long (Buy) at the current end-of-week price close of the DJIA when the ROC over the past 18 weeks is greater than zero. Close Long (Sell) at the current end-of-week price close of the DJIA when the ROC over the past 18 weeks is less than zero. Enter Short (Sell Short) never. Starting with $100 and reinvesting profits, total net profits for this ROC trend- following strategy would have been $91,674.62, assuming a fully invested strategy, reinvestment of profits, no transactions costs and no taxes. This would have been 305.37 percent greater than buy-and-hold. No short selling would have been prof- itable, and no short selling was included in the strategy. Long-only ROC as an indi- cator would have given profitable buy signals 43.06% of the time. Trading would have been relatively inactive at one trade every 176.43 calendar days. The Equis International MetaStock® System Testing rules are written as follows: Enter long: ROC(C,opt1,%)>0 Close long: ROC(C,opt1,%)<0 OPT1 Current value: 18 600 Technical Market Indicators Relative Strength (Ratio Analysis) Relative strength analysis is a powerful tool for stock selection and timing. Two methods of analyzing relative strength are the traditional ratio method and the com- puterized screening method. The traditional ratio method precisely quantifies the price strength of each investment instrument or index compared to another instrument or index. Relative strength analysis is not limited to stock prices but also is applied to the prices of commodities, currencies, and anything that trades. Naturally, relative strength is productively applied to industry groups and broader sectors. (See Sector Rotation.) The screening method compares and ranks each instrument or index to a much larger universe of all relevant instruments and indexes. The relative strength screen- ing method is particularly flexible, since anything that trades can be compared to any- thing else that trades or to everything else that trades. Published research studies conducted over many decades of actual historical stock price data show that a stock that is behaving well relative to the larger market probably will continue to outperform. Conversely, a stock that is behaving poorly rel- ative to the market likely will continue to underperform. The Traditional Ratio Method for Analysis of Relative Strength As a common example of the ratio method, we simply divide a particular stock’s price by a market index, mostly typically, the S&P 500 Composite Stock Price Index. Alternately, we may divide the stock’s price by any index of significance to that stock, such as a related industry or sector index. The resulting ratio is plotted like a typical price/time line chart, but with relative strength on the vertical y-axis and time on the horizontal x-axis. The resulting relative strength ratio line can be analyzed using all the estab- lished technical methods, including trendlines, moving averages, patterns, momentum oscillators, divergences, and so on. A rising relative strength trend simply tells us that the stock is outperforming the market. Note that a stock could actually go down in price while at the same time its relative strength ratio is rising, so long as the general market index (the ratio’s denominator) goes down proportionately more than the stock’s price (the ratio’s numerator). This would imply that the stock has a better de- mand/supply balance than the general market. On the bearish side, a falling relative strength trend says that the that the stock has a worse demand/supply balance than the general market. Technical analysts compare the pure price trend and momentum of a stock to its own relative strength line’s trend and momentum, looking for either an ‘all-clear’ confirmation of trend continuation or a ‘warning’ divergence of possible trend Relative Strength (Ratio Analysis) 601 Chart by permission of Salomon Smith Barney. 602 Technical Market Indicators change ahead. When both the pure price trend and the relative strength ratio line are both rising and making new highs, indications are all-clear, or in gear, for bullish trend continuation. But when price is making a new high and the relative strength ra- tio line fails to make a new high, that clearly says that investors prefer other stocks over that stock, and that can be an early warning of possible price trouble ahead. Ag- gressive traders will start to liquidate the stock at this first sign of trouble, while pa- tient long-term holders may wait for the price trend to turn down as well, thus, confirming the deteriorating relative strength ratio line. Conversely, in bearish mar- kets, when the relative strength ratio line turns upward, that is an early indication of a possible better price trend ahead, but again the odds of being correct are better when the price trend also confirms by turning upward. There is a solid rational behind this analysis. In the later stages of a bear market, for example, ‘strong-hands’ investors begin to accumulate the stocks they have the most confidence in, placing large bids that support the prices, so that the prices of the best, most desirable stocks stabilize before most other stocks. Thus, the best stocks begin to outperform a falling general market, causing their relative strength ratio lines to rise. Conversely, well into a bull market, ‘smart-money’ investors anticipating fu- ture conditions will begin to offer out large quantities of the stocks they lack confi- dence in, putting lids on those stocks’ price appreciation even as the general market is still rising. This supply causes the relative strength ratio lines of such stocks to turn down. Alan R. Shaw, CMT, observes that relative strength often runs in long secular trends that can persist for many years. Stocks and industry groups in strong technical relative strength uptrends are likely to continue to outperform the market until both price and relative strength lose momentum and change direction on a major-trend ba- sis. That kind of trend change generally takes months to develop. Conversely, stocks and groups in major negative relative strength trends can underperform the broad market for many years. Shaw divides the prices of stocks and industry group indexes by the S&P 500 Index, he analyzes these ratios in conjunction with the raw price data, and he constantly watches for tandem confirmation (suggesting the continuation of an existing trend) or divergence (suggesting a significant trend change). One of Shaw’s favorite relative strength charts appears on page 601. The upper half of the page shows a 72-year monthly price line chart of the DJIA from 1926 to 1998. The lower half of the page shows, from 1930 to 1998, a 68-year monthly tradi- tional relative strength ratio line of the price of the S&P Capital Goods stock industry groups divided by the S&P Consumer Goods stock industry groups. Despite obvious cyclical noise (that is, the smaller swings lasting a few months), the persistence of long-term, secular relative strength trends is evident. The two longest lasting direc- tional moves lasted 11 and 12 years. Four full cycles, low to low, lasted 14, 17, 8, and 21 years. 604 Technical Market Indicators The Ned Davis Research chart on page 603 shows the relative strength ratio of growth stocks divided by value stocks. Growth stocks outperformed value stocks for many years until 1974 (not shown). Growth stocks underperformed value stocks for 14 years from 1974 to 1988. Then, growth stocks outperformed value stocks again for 12 years from 1988 to 2000. Clearly, major relative strength trends can run in long cycles. This ratio method of analysis is most useful to professional technical analysts and portfolio managers, and it can be useful to anyone following a moderately sized universe of closely analyzed stocks. The ratio method may be time-consuming and impractical, however, for screening many thousands of stocks and other instruments using consistent and objective criteria. Moreover, the traditional technical methods of chart interpretation may be subject to the analyst’s personal experiences, preferences, bias, and judgments. To overcome these deficiencies, technical analysts devised the computerized screening method for analyzing relative strength. The Screening Method for Analysis of Relative Strength Many analysts prefer the screening method over the ratio method. With the comput- erized screening method’s predefined criteria programmed into a computer, any fi- nancial instrument can be quantitatively measured and ranked, quickly and objectively, against many thousands of competing instruments. For example, the en- tire universe of all stocks, all futures, all commodities and all currencies can be effi- ciently ranked form best to worst relative strength performance. The most prominent advocate of the screening method is Charles D. Kirk- patrick, CMT. He is widely recognized for his research on relative strength, which he has studied intensively for several decades, since the late 1960’s, when he and Robert A. Levy, Ph.D., worked together on a variety of experiments in technical forecasting. Kirkpatrick’s current relative strength model, which he has published continuously since 1982, has outperformed the S&P 500 by more than four to one. Kirkpatrick’s screening method ranks 5,000 stocks each week by their relative strength, from strongest to weakest. Every stock’s recent performance is compared against the whole universe of stocks, over a constant, pre-defined specific time pe- riod. Kirkpatrick’s method of measuring relative price performance is to divide the closing price each Thursday by the trailing 26-week moving average of those weekly prices. Then that ratio for each stock is ranked against the comparable calculations for all other stocks, forming a list of stocks ordered by performance from strongest to weakest. The top percentiles of the list represent the top performing stocks, those with the highest relative strength. Conversely, the bottom percentiles of the list represent the worst performing stocks, those with the lowest relative strength. The midpoint of the list shows the median past performance. Relative Strength (Ratio Analysis) 605 Kirkpatrick has found through exhaustive back-testing confirmed by long real- time experience that the time interval over which relative strength screening is calcu- lated is critical. As he varied the time window, both shorter and longer, statistical significance declined. Particularly, the shortest time periods, less than six weeks, pro- duce consistently negative results, thus confirming the established wisdom of the pi- oneer technicians, such as Charles Dow, who taught that the shorter-term trends are more noisy. Focusing on the strongest stocks is the basis of the sometimes wildly popular ‘momentum investing,’ that is, buying those stocks with the highest upside price ve- locity without regard to any other considerations. This speculative style, taken to ex- tremes, leads to Alan Greenspan’s ‘irrational exuberance,’ or excessive stock price valuations. Precisely where the momentum game runs out of steam has proven to be difficult to pinpoint in actual practice. Kirkpatrick acknowledges that stock prices can be driven to unsustainable extremes. There is always some danger of buying at a top or selling at a bottom when following relative strength. Moreover, when the trend re- verses, an extended stock can revert to its mean quickly, taking away months of price progress in a matter of days. Long observation suggests, however, that more often the strongest stocks remain strong to the very end of a bull market, even after the general market already has begun a cyclical decline. The strongest stocks often are the last to be hit by selling in the more advanced stages of a general market decline. Kirkpatrick’s method has been extensively tested and found to be statistically significant in academic literature. See Robert A. Levy, Ph.D., the Journal of Finance, December 1967, pages 595-610. More recently, the value of Kirkpatrick’s screening method was recognized by Narasimhan Jegadeesh and Sheridan Titman, ‘Returns to Buying Winners and Selling Losers: Implications for Stock Market Efficiency,’ Jour- nal of Finance, vol. XLVIII, No. 1, March 1993, pages 65–91. Kirkpatrick’s research is available through Kirkpatrick & Company, Inc., 7669 County Road 502, Bayfield, CO, 81122, e-mail: kirkco@capecod.net. Relative Price Strength (RS) Ratings for thousands of stocks are available each day in Investor’s Business Daily financial newspaper. According to publisher William J. O’Neil, he calculates each stock’s price change over the latest year, then he ranks this price velocity against all other stocks. These RS ranks are expressed on a per- centile scale, with 99 representing the strongest price performers and 1 the worst price velocity. For example, a stock with an 80 RS Rating outperformed 80% of all other stocks over the past year and, based on this above-average RS, is a possible buy can- didate. Stocks dropping below a 70 RS Rating show weakening relative price perfor- mance and might be possible sell candidates. Stocks with high RS Ratings have greater upside potential, while stocks with low RS Ratings are more vulnerable to dis- appointments. The average RS Rating in O’Neil’s models of the Greatest Stock Mar- ket Winners was 87 before these stocks made their biggest price advances. O’Neil has had best results combining RS with chart interpretation, catching stocks with high RS 606 Technical Market Indicators just as they are beginning to emerge from a base-building pattern. When RS is ex- tremely high and the price is extended relative to its base, it is time to sell. (O’Neil, William J., How to Make Money in Stocks: a Winning System in Good Times or Bad, McGraw-Hill, New York, 1991, 248 pages.) Published studies suggest that the strong tend to grow stronger and the weak tend to become weaker over long-term time intervals measured in months and years. Independent academic research confirms that momentum strategies are most prof- itable at the medium time horizon, 3 to 12 months, according to Conrad and Kaul, ‘An Anatomy of Trading Strategies’, The Review of Financial Studies, volume 11, Fall 1998, pages 489–519. Top-ranked stocks by relative price strength rose in price at a 70% annual rate over the past 15 years, four times faster than the 18% annual rate recorded by Value Line’s top-ranked stocks (by both earnings and price momentum), and 4.5 times faster than the 15.6% annual price appreciation of the S&P 500 index, according to data provided by Samuel Eisenstadt, Research Chairman of the Value Line Invest- ment Survey, Value Line Selection & Opinion, Value Line Publishing, Inc., 220 East 42nd Street, New York, NY 10017-5891, January 28, 2000, pages 5099-5114. The 35- year average performance of Value Line’s top Timeliness stocks (highest earnings and price momentum) is more than 20%, compounded annually, 2.4 times faster than the S&P 500 market price appreciation of 8.4%. All data is exclusive of transactions costs, dividends and taxes. Past performance is a good indicator of future performance, according to Jonathan Clements, ‘Hot Stocks Are Sizzling on Momentum’, The Wall Street Jour- nal, September 7, 1999, page C1. If a stock has dazzling performance one year, there is a good chance it will post better-than-average performance the next. ‘Winners con- tinue to win, but losers really continue to lose,’ says Tobias Moskowitz, Professor of Finance at the University of Chicago. The reason may be that investors are slow to re- act to new information, and analysts tend to change their earnings estimates too grad- ually in an attempt to avoid the career risk of going too far out on a limb, according to John Bogel, Jr., president of Bogel Investment Management. Also, with mutual funds, last year’s top-performing funds often continue to outperform, according to a study by Mark Carhart, co-head of quantitative research for Goldman Sachs Asset Management, published in the March 1997 Journal of Finance. This study was based on stock-fund performance for the 31 years ended December 1993. The top 10% funds in one year did noticeably better than average the next year. But funds in the bottom 10% lagged badly the subsequent year. The top performers earned an average of eight percentage points per year more than the worst performing funds. Moreover, there is a strong tendency for the worst performers to continue trailing, and this bad performance often persisted until the funds were liquidated or merged. The poor per- formers tended to be funds that charge high expenses and trade rapidly. Another study by Sheldon Jacobs, editor of No-load Fund Investor newsletter, found that buying the Relative Strength (Ratio Analysis) 607 top diversified no-load fund each year returned 22.2% annually over the past 23 years, and that was 48% better than the 15% return of the average U.S. diversified fund. Mark Carhart suggests that persistence of relative performance of funds reflects more the continued momentum in the underlying stocks, rather than any particular ac- tions by fund management. Clements concludes that investors need not be afraid to buy stocks that have performed well, and they should not be anxious to buy stocks that have been crushed. ‘Keep momentum on your side, by hanging onto winning investments, while dumping your losers quickly. Academic research suggests that the best performing stocks and funds in any given year often enjoy good results in the year that follows. Meanwhile, losing positions tend to keep on losing,’ according to Jonathan Clements, ‘Rules for When You Shred the Rules’, The Wall Street Journal, January 25, 2000, page C1. Clements quotes investment researcher James P. O’Shaughnessy, chairman of O’Shaughnessy Capital Management in Greenwich, CT, ‘Let the momentum work for you. If you’ve got five stocks and two are winning, sell the other three and con- centrate your money on the ones that are winning. And the minute you see a break in the momentum, get out.’ Clements adds, ‘This is also the smartest tax strategy . . . By hanging onto your winners, you delay the capital-gains tax bill, while selling losers generates a loss that can be used to reduce your taxes.’ The top investment strategies ‘buy stocks with the best relative price strength,’ O’Shaughnessy concludes. On a risk adjusted basis, the worst performing strategy is buying the stocks with the worst 1-year performance. ‘Avoid last year’s biggest price losers at all costs—their record over the last 40 years is abysmal.’ For further details on his research and a detailed bibliography of serious books and papers on investment returns and risks, see O’Shaughnessy, James P., What Works on Wall Street, Revised Edition, McGraw-Hill, New York, 1998. Kirkpatrick Finds that Relative Strength Substantially Outperforms the Market Relative price strength works well with real-time, unseen data over the long-term, ac- cording to Charles D. Kirkpatrick II, CMT. (See Kirkpatrick, C. D., ‘Stock Selection: A Test of Relative Stock Values Reported over 17.5 Years’, www.mta.org, 2001.) In summary, in July 1982, Kirkpatrick established stock selection and deletion criteria and determined the performance measurement method (equally weighting each stock each week) for his first study, which he named ‘List 1’. From July 1982 to December 31, 2000, List 1 had appreciated 5,086.6%, versus a 1,087.6% gain for the S&P 500, and a 221.9% gain for the Value Line Geometric. During that 17.5 year period, both List 1 and the S&P 500 suffered three down years, compared to seven down years for the Value Line Geometric. List 1 stock selection criteria included three variables: high relative price strength, high relative earnings growth, and a strong chart pattern. 608 Technical Market Indicators In January 1999, Kirkpatrick started ‘List 2,’ which, as of December 31, 2000, had appreciated 137.3%, versus a gain of 7.41% for the S&P 500, and a loss of 9.99% for Value Line Geometric. List 2 had no down years, compared to one down year for the S&P and two down years for the Value Line Geometric. The selection criteria for List 2 also included three variables: high relative price strength, high earnings growth, and a low relative price-to-sales ratio (PSR). List 2 also substantially outperformed List 1, which gained 75.19% over the same 2-year period, 1999 and 2000. Kirkpatrick’s testing did not include dividends and transaction costs. Kirk- patrick published each list each week in Kirkpatrick’s Institutional Market Strategist, Kirkpatrick & Company, Inc., 7669 County Road 502, Bayfield, CO, 81122, e-mail: kirkco@capecod.net. List 2 was added in 1999 to supplement List 1, which continued on exactly as before. For List 1, the strong chart pattern criterion was designed to function as a stop-loss on negative price action, but later tests of the simple price pattern alone showed no discernible advantage was gained. So, List 2 was begun using an alternate risk-reduction approach, selecting only those stocks trading at low relative price to sales ratios. Compared to List 1, List 2 offered three advantages over the two years of real-time testing: • Portfolio volatility declined nearly in half, with a portfolio beta consistently below one for List 2, versus a portfolio beta often approaching two for List 1. • Turnover declined and average holding period more than doubled, to well over a year for List 2, up from 22 weeks for List 1. • The size of the List 2 portfolio was considerably smaller and more manage- able, 5 to 15 stocks for List 2, versus up to 80 stocks for List 1. Relative Price Strength Rank was defined as each stock’s price performance measured equally against all other stocks’ price performance. The ratio of each stock’s current price divided by its own trailing 26-week moving average was ranked against the equivalent ratios of all other stocks, with the highest ratios and the high- est percentile ranks representing the highest relative strength. Thus, the 99th per- centile represented the strongest stock and the 0 percentile represented the weakest. The closing price used each week was the Thursday close. A stock was eliminated from both lists when relative price strength declined to or below the 30th percentile. Relative Earnings Growth was defined as the 1-year rate of change of a moving four-quarter average. As with relative price strength, the rate of change of earnings for each stock was ranked against the rate of change of earnings for all other stocks. High ranking stocks were chosen for both lists. A stock was eliminated from List 1 when relative earnings growth declined to or below the top 80th percentile. A stock was eliminated from List 2 when relative earnings growth declined to or below the 50th percentile. Relative Strength (Ratio Analysis) 609 For List 1 only, Chart Pattern was defined as advancing if the latest price direc- tional movement was above the two most recent previous high price pivots, and only those advancing stocks were considered for selection. The Chart Pattern was declin- ing if the latest price directional movement was below the two most recent low price pivots, and those declining stocks were eliminated. For List 2 only, a requirement for addition to the list was a Relative Price/Sales Ratio (PSR) at or below the 30th percentile. The lower the PSR the greater the poten- tial for positive surprise. The higher the PSR the higher the risk. O’Shaughnessy (1998) argues that the PSR is the most reliable method of selecting stocks for long term appreciation. (O’Shaughnessy, James P., What Works on Wall Street: A Guide to the Best-Performing Investment Strategies of All Time, McGraw-Hill, New York, 1998.) The basic PSR is the current weekly close price divided by the last reported four-quarters sales. PSR was not included in List 2 deletion criteria. Each week the entire list of available U.S. stocks (usually around 5,000) was screened by the above criteria. Any stock not already on the list that met the selection criteria was added to the list. For List 1 only, a stock was eliminated when relative price strength declined to or below the 30th percentile, when relative earnings growth declined to or below the top 80th percentile, or when the stock price chart pattern broke two previous lower re- versal points. For List 2 only, a stock was eliminated when relative price strength declined to or below the 30th percentile, or when relative earnings growth declined to or below the 50th percentile. (Relative Price/Sales Ratio was not included in deletion criteria.) 610 Technical Market Indicators Relative Strength Index (RSI) The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is one of the most popular price momentum indi- cators. RSI is misnamed, since it has nothing to do with the well-established techni- cal analysis concept of Relative Strength, which compares the price of one financial instrument or index with another. RSI was first described by J. Welles Wilder, Jr., in his 1978 book, New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems (Trend Research, PO Box 128, McLeansville, NC 27301). Mathematically, RSI is represented as: RSI 100 (100/(1 RS)) where RS is the ratio of the exponentially smoothed moving average of n-period gains divided by the absolute value (i.e., ignoring sign) of the exponentially smoothed moving average of n-period losses. An example calculating RSI follows on pages 616–617. As you can see by the formula, RSI does not relate any security to any other se- curity. Rather, RSI quantifies price momentum. It depends solely on the changes in closing prices. Despite its name, it has absolutely nothing in common with the tradi- tional Relative Strength concept, whereby the price of a stock is divided by a broad market index (such as the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index) to arrive at a ratio that shows the trend of a stock’s performance relative to the general market. Instead, Wilder’s RSI is actually a front-weighted price velocity ratio for only one item (a stock, a fu- tures contract, or an index). And, in conformity with the standard interpretation of price velocity indicators generally, Wilder places considerable emphasis on confir- mations and divergences of RSI compared to the underlying price series. RSI’s method of calculation, using Exponential Moving Averages, correctly avoids the problem of erratic movement caused solely by dropping off old data, that is, the problem of the ‘take away’ number, a problem that plagues such popular indicators as short Simple Moving Averages, Rate of Change, and Stochastics. Exponential smoothing also eliminates the need to work with long columns of historical data each day. Obviously, the smaller n is, the shorter the period measured and the more sensitive the indicator, while the larger n is, the longer the period measured and the less sensitive the indicator. Wilder’s suggested n-period length is 14 days. Other popular lengths are 20, 10, 8, 7, and 5 days. We found that the shortest one, 5 days produced the best result. The indicator can also be applied to any time frame, from minutes to months. RSI’s method of calculation, using ratios, tames the indicator’s y-axis range to limits of 0 to 100. Due to its use of ratios, however, RSI seems to be subject to greater volatility and erratic movement than smoothed indicators that are not dependent on ratios. 612 Technical Market Indicators Example of Welles Wilder’s RSI over Four Periods Indicator Strategy Example for RSI RSI requires experience and judgement to use as Wilder intended. Even naïve testing assumptions suggest that RSI may have some objective potential value as a purely mechanical, contra-trend technical indicator. The great majority of oversold buy sig- nals would have been profitable. Moreover, these buy signals would have been ro- bust, with all RSI lengths from 2 to 21 days profitable and right most of the time, for long trades only. Relative Strength Index (RSI) 613 Example of Welles Wilder’s RSI over Four Periods (continued) As attractive as a high percentage of profitable trades may seem, however, it is important to note that this (like other contra-trend strategies) failed to provide any protection in the Crash of ’87, the decline of 1998 and other market price drops. As the chart shows, there are sharp equity drawdowns. Using RSI for contra-trend over- sold and overbought signals underperformed the passive buy-and-hold strategy for long trades only, while short selling would not have been profitable in the past. Relative Strength Index (RSI) 615 Based on an 18-year file of daily data for the entire history of the S&P 500 Composite Stock Price Index futures CSI Perpetual Contract, collected from www.csidata.com, from 4/21/82 to 12/08/00, we found that the following parameters would have produced a positive result on a purely mechanical signal basis with no subjectivity, no sophisticated technical analysis, and no judgement: Enter Long (Buy) at the current daily price close of the S&P 500 Com- posite Stock Price Index futures CSI Perpetual Contract when the 5-day RSI(5) is less than 30. Close Long (Sell) at the current daily price close of the S&P 500 Com- posite Stock Price Index futures CSI Perpetual Contract when the 5-day RSI(5) is greater than 70. Enter Short (Sell Short) never. Starting with $100 and reinvesting profits, total net profits for this RSI counter- trend strategy would have been $717.36, assuming a fully invested strategy, reinvest- ment of profits, no transactions costs and no taxes. This would have been 31.39 percent less than buy-and-hold. No short selling would have been profitable, and no short selling was included in the strategy. Short selling would have cut the profit in half. Long-only RSI as an indicator would have given profitable buy signals 85.94% of the time. Trading would have been relatively inactive at one trade every 53.18 cal- endar days. Note that this strategy considers closing prices only while ignoring intra- day highs and lows. The Equis International MetaStock® System Testing rules for RSI are written as follows: Enter long: RSI(opt1)<30 Close long: RSI(opt1)>70 OPT1 Current value: 5 618 Technical Market Indicators Relative Volatility Index (RVI) The Relative Volatility Index (RVI) measures the direction of price volatility and is used as a filter to confirm an independent price momentum indicator. RVI was devel- oped by Donald G. Dorsey and first introduced in the June 1993 issue of Technical Analysis of Stocks and Commodities magazine (www.traders.com). A revision to the indicator was covered in the September 1995 issue. The RVI calculation is similar to the RSI (See Relative Strength Index) except that the RVI measures the standard deviation of daily price changes rather than ab- solute price changes. RSI separates each day’s closing price net changes into positive changes and negative changes, then RSI smoothes and normalizes these changes by using ratios that produce a standard scale from zero to 100. The RVI uses the same basic formula but substitutes the 10-day standard deviation of the closing prices for the net changes. RVI was designed to measure the direction of volatility. Dorsey reasoned that a trading system might be improved if a confirming indicator, used as a filter, were added to one of the price momentum indicators. This filter, the RVI, calculated strength by measuring volatility rather than price change, adding the diversification previously lacking in many systems. RVI was designed to be an indicator that could be used to confirm without duplicating signals from a trend-momentum indicator (such as RSI, MACD, Stochastics, Rate of Change, Price Oscillators such as a dual moving average crossover system, and so forth). As Dorsey asserts, ‘Because the RVI measures a different set of market dynamics than other indicators, it is often superior as a confirming indicator…The RVI’s advantage is as a confirming indicator because it provides a level of diversification missing in the RSI.’ Dorsey tested the profitability of a moving average crossover strategy and found that results could be improved by adding RVI rules for confirmation. Indicator Strategy Example for RVI Our testing confirmed that RVI does indeed filter out many signals, but profitability would not have been significantly better than the passive buy-and-hold strategy. Based on a merged 20-year file of adjusted daily data for the entire histories of the S&P 500 Depositary Receipts since 1993, the S&P futures from 1982 to 1993, and cash S&P 500 Stock Price Index from 1980 to 1982, we found that the following parameters would have produced the following result on a purely mechanical trend- following signal basis with no subjectivity, no sophisticated technical analysis, and no judgement: Relative Volatility Index (RVI) 619 Enter Long (Buy) at the current daily price close of the S&P when the 280-period RVI is greater than 50 and the current day’s price close is greater than yesterday’s 140-day EMA of the daily closing prices. Close Long (Sell) at the current daily price close of the S&P when the 280-period RVI is less than 50 and the current day’s price close is less than yesterday’s 140-day EMA of the daily closing prices. Enter Short (Sell Short) at the current daily price close of the S&P when the 280-period RVI is less than 50 and the current day’s price close is less than yesterday’s 140-day EMA of the daily closing prices. Close Short (Cover) at the current daily price close of the S&P when the 280-period RVI is greater than 50 and the current day’s price close is greater than yesterday’s 140-day EMA of the daily closing prices. Starting with $100 and reinvesting profits, total net profits for this RVI trend- following strategy would have been $867.42, assuming a fully invested strategy, rein- vestment of profits, no transactions costs and no taxes. This would have been only 1.33 percent better than buy-and-hold. Trading would have been extremely inactive with only five signals in 20 years, making this indicator ineffective as a trading guide. The Equis International MetaStock® System Testing rules for the pre-processed RVI indicator are written as follows: Enter long: RVI(opt1) > 50 AND CLOSE > Ref(Mov(CLOSE,opt2,E), 1) Close long: RVI(opt1) < 50 AND CLOSE < Ref(Mov(CLOSE,opt2,E), 1) Enter short: RVI(opt1) < 50 AND CLOSE < Ref(Mov(CLOSE,opt2,E), 1) Close short: RVI(opt1) > 50 AND CLOSE > Ref(Mov(CLOSE,opt2,E), 1) OPT1 Current value: 280 OPT2 Current value: 140 622 Technical Market Indicators Renko Charts The Japanese Renko Chart is a unique kind of a line chart designed to filter out mi- nor, short-term market noise. It is similar to the western Point and Figure technique in that price movement (and not the passage of time) determines the progress along the horizontal x-axis. We make a chart entry (which is called a renga in Japanese, a brick in English) only when price moves by a fixed and predetermined amount, or box size, expressed in some obvious unit of local currency, such as one dollar. A difference is that instead of using intraday high and low extremes like a west- ern Point and Figure Chart, the Japanese Renko Chart uses the close to determine when to lay a new renga (brick). The current close is compared with the high and low of the previous brick. In an uptrend, when this close rises above the top of the previ- ous brick by at least the box size (or a greater amount), then one or more white bricks are laid above and in the next column to the right. If the uptrend reverses, indicated by the current closing price falling below the bottom of the previous brick by at least the box size, then one or more black bricks are laid below and in the next column to the right. Charting the S&P Depositary Receipts (SPY) for the full year 2000, January through December, using MetaStock® software, the two charts compare the 1 point box size Renko Chart to the similar 1 point box size and 1 point reversal Point and Figure Chart. (See Nison, S. (1994). Beyond Candlesticks. New York: Wiley.) Resistance At the most basic level, Support and Resistance are previous lows and highs. Also, the sloping trendlines and price channels that contain the price action within orderly as- cending or descending patterns offer moving points of Support and Resistance that function similarly to horizontal trading ranges. (See Support and Resistance.) Resistance Index, Art Merrill’s The Resistance Index measures the difference between resistance to downward price swings and resistance to upward price swings. Resistance is defined as the NYSE vol- ume required to move the Dow-Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) one point. This indi- cator was invented by Arthur A. Merrill, CMT. 624 Technical Market Indicators Merrill’s Resistance Index may be calculated and interpreted in ten steps. 1. Gather DJIA price and NYSE volume data for each hour of trading. 2. Calculate the DJIA total net points change each hour, respecting sign, plus or minus. 3. 4. 5. Total the plus point changes (from Step 2) for the week. Total the volume for the hours with plus point changes for the week. Divide the total weekly plus-point volume (from Step 4) by the total weekly plus point changes (from Step 3). This is rise resistance. 6. Repeat Steps 3, 4 and 5 substituting minus point changes and their associ- ated volume. This is decline resistance. 7. Subtract rise resistance (from Step 5) from decline resistance (from Step 6). This is net resistance. 8. Smooth that net resistance (from Step 7) with a 13-week exponential mov- ing average (EMA). This is the Resistance Index. 9. When the Resistance Index is more than 67% of one standard deviation be- low its mean, it is bullish. 10. When the Resistance Index is more than 67% of one standard deviation above its mean, it is bearish. Measuring the 11 years from 1971 to 1982, over a 52-week forward window of time, Merrill found his Resistance Index correctly predicted the market direction 64% of the time. Statistically, this was highly significant. Over 26-weeks, it was right more often than not, but not significantly so. Over 5- and 1-weeks, it was wrong more of- ten than right, though not significantly. The Rule of Seven The Rule of Seven is a guideline for roughly estimating price targets for a significant price move. It uses a multiple of the point price distance of the first wave in the move to estimate (usually three) tentative price objectives in advance. For an uptrend, the Rule of Seven method first subtracts the highest high of the first wave up from the low that marked the beginning of the uptrend. This difference is expressed in points of price, not in percentages. This difference is multiplied by the ratio of the integer 7 divided by the integers 1 to 7. That product is then added to the original low to arrive at an upside objective. For example, the point size of the first up wave is multiplied by 7/3, then that product is added to the low price. When the S&P 500 rose from a low of 102.20 in August 1982 to a high of 337.90 in August 1987, the difference was 235.70 points. That difference multiplied by 7/3 (which is 2.33) is 549.97. Then that product added back to the original low of 102.20 equals 652.17, which is an upside objective. We can easily set up a spread sheet, as shown. The most The Rule of Seven 625 probable upside objectives are 7/4, 7/3, and 7/2 times the price range of the first wave. These proved to be too conservative, in this case. Similarly, for a downtrend, the price size in points of the first down wave is mul- tiplied by a fraction, and that product is subtracted from the high to arrive at an down- side objective. The most probable downside objectives are 7/5, 7/4 and 7/3 times the price range of the first wave. For example, the point size of the first down wave is multiplied by 7/5, then that product is subtracted from the high price. When the S&P 500 fell from a high of 1553.11 in March 2000 to a low of 1339.40 in April 2000, the difference was 213.71 points. That difference multiplied by 7/5 (which is 1.40) is 299.19. Then that product subtracted from the original high of 1553.11 equals 1253.92. The S&P 500 fell 1254.07 on December 21, 2000—almost a direct hit. Af- ter that, the S&P bounced up 10% to 1383.37 by January 31, 2001.

Short Interest Ratio The Short Interest Ratio is a long-term, Contrary Opinion sentiment indicator. It is calculated by dividing the monthly short interest figure released by the New York Stock Exchange by the average volume of trading per day during that month. When a relatively large amount of short selling activity is evident, traders obvi- ously have speculated that stock prices are likely to move lower. A relatively high Short Interest Ratio adds to potential buying demand for stocks because bears must eventually cover their shorts (that is, they must buy the stock they previously sold short). This buying power is potential fuel for a rally. Relatively low levels of short selling produce low Short Interest Ratio readings. These low levels are not bullish because they represent little buying power. The Short Interest Ratio has changed its behavior substantially over the past two decades, with the dynamic growth of new derivative markets for options and futures. These, plus active mergers and acquisitions activity, have produced a proliferation of complex arbitrage strategies. In the early 1980’s, less than 25% of the NYSE issues reporting short interest were affected by arbitrage transactions, but that rose to more than 50% later in that decade. We need an adaptive, evolving technical indicator to keep pace with these changing levels of activity. Indicator Strategy Example for the Short Interest Ratio Based on 69-years of monthly data for the Short Interest Ratio and the DJIA from January,1932, through December, 2000, we found that the following parameters would have produced a positive result on a purely mechanical trend-following signal basis with no subjectivity, no sophisticated technical analysis, and no judgement: Enter Long (Buy) at the current month-end price close of the DJIA when the current Short Interest Ratio is greater than the previous month’s 74- month EMA of the Short Interest Ratio. Close Long (Sell) at the current month-end price close of the DJIA when the current Short Interest Ratio is less than the previous month’s 74-month EMA of the Short Interest Ratio. Enter Short (Sell Short) never. Starting with $100 and reinvesting profits, total net profits for this Short Inter- est Ratio trend-following strategy would have been $5,888.84, assuming a fully 640 Technical Market Indicators invested strategy, reinvestment of profits, no transactions costs and no taxes. This would have been 57.89 percent less than buy-and-hold. No short selling would have been profitable, and no short selling was included in the strategy. Short selling would have cut the profit by more than half. The long-only Short Interest Ratio as an indi- cator would have given profitable buy signals 72.97% of the time. Trading would have been inactive at one trade every 340.16 calendar days. Note that this strategy considers month-end closing prices only, while ignoring all daily price movements. The Equis International MetaStock® System Testing rules (where the Short In- terest Ratio is inserted into the data field normally reserved for Volume) are written as follows: Enter long: V > Ref(Mov(V,opt1,E),-1) Close long: V < Ref(Mov(V,opt1,E),-1) OPT1 Current value: 74 Sign of the Bear This breadth momentum indicator was developed by market newsletter publisher and portfolio manager, Peter G. Eliades, Stockmarket Cycles, P. O. Box 6873, Santa Rosa, CA 95406-0873, phone (707) 769-4800, fax (707) 769-4803, e-mail: peter@eliades.net. There are three requirements for the Sign of the Bear: 1. There must be 21 to 27 consecutive trading days where the daily advance/de- cline ratio on the NYSE is both above 0.65 and below 1.95. This indicates a churning market that is going nowhere. 2. That 21 to 27 day quiet period must be broken by a one-daily advance/de- cline ratio below 0.65. This is the first sign of negative trend change. 3. Finally, the 2-day average of the advance/decline ratio must fall below 0.75. This 2-day average may include the initial day below 0.65 that triggers Re- quirement 2. This confirms negative trend change. The advance/decline ratio is the number of advancing issues divided by the number of declining issues each day on the NYSE. A 2-day average is the current ad- vance/decline ratio added to the previous day’s advance/decline ratio, then that sum is divided by two. The following table shows that there have been only seven signals for the Sign of the Bear since 1929. Some have been a few weeks before the final price high of the Sign of the Bear 641 bull market. Each signal has been followed by a drop in the DJIA ranging from 21% to 89% and averaging 39%. Date Drop 7/22/29 89% 12/14/61 29% 1/31/66 27% 10/25/68 36% 12/12/72 45% 4/6/98 21% 9/18/00 27% Average 39% Indicator Example of the Advance/Decline Ratio Oscillator 2-day EMA Crossing 0.75 Eliades’ Sign of the Bear lacks an exit rule, a buy signal to close out the sell signal. Breadth-Momentum Oscillators can be used as part of a complete trend-following strategy, however. Based on a 68-year file of daily data for the number of shares ad- vancing and declining each day on the NYSE and the DJIA since March 8, 1932, we found that the following specific parameters would have produced a positive result on a purely mechanical signal basis with no subjectivity, no sophisticated technical analysis, and no judgement: Enter Long (Buy) at the current daily price close of the DJIA when the 2-day EMA of the daily Advance/Decline Ratio rises to cross above 0.75. Close Long (Sell) at the current daily price close of the DJIA when the 2-day EMA of the daily Advance/Decline Ratio falls to cross below 0.75. Enter Short (Sell Short) at the current daily price close of the DJIA when the 2-day EMA of the daily Advance/Decline Ratio falls to cross below 0.75. Close Short (Cover) at the current daily price close of the DJIA when the 2-day EMA of the daily Advance/Decline Ratio rises to cross above 0.75. Starting with $100 and reinvesting profits, total net profits for this Breadth-Mo- mentum Oscillator trend-following strategy would have been $10,533,586, assuming a fully invested strategy, reinvestment of profits, no transactions costs and no taxes. This would have been 83,908.87 percent better than buy-and-hold. Even short selling would have been profitable. Trading would have been very active with one trade every 6.76 calendar days. 644 Technical Market Indicators The Equis International MetaStock® System Testing rules, where the current Advance/Decline Ratio multiplied by 1000 (to avoid handling fractions) is inserted into the data field normally reserved for Volume (V), are written as follows: Enter long: Mov(V,opt1,E)>opt2 Close long: Mov(V,opt1,E)<opt2 Enter short: Mov(V,opt1,E)<opt2 Close short: Mov(V,opt1,E)>opt2 OPT1 Current value: 2 OPT2 Current value: 750 Simple Moving Average (SMA): Moving Arithmetic Mean Mathematically, a simple arithmetic mean formula is represented as: Mk k 1 n i k n 1 Ci (Ck n 1 Ck n 2 Ck n 3. . . Ck) n where Mk the simple moving average arithmetic mean at period k. Ci the closing price for period i. n the total number of periods to be included in the moving mean calculation. k the number of the position of the period being studied within the total number of periods in the database (see example, page 649). The Simple Moving Average (SMA) is probably the simplest, oldest, and most widely used statistical method applied to stock price data. For example, the 200-day simple moving average has been a popular and moderately effective guide to stock market transaction timing for many decades. To compute it, we simply add together the closing prices for the past 200 trading days, then divide that sum by 200. Before computers, technicians took a shortcut, adding up the weekly closing prices over 40 weeks, then dividing by 40. Assuming five trading days in a week, 200 days is 40 weeks (200/5 40). Or, if they were extremely computationally adverse, they added 10 month-end closing prices then divided by 10. Assuming twenty trading days in a month, 200 days is 10 months (200/20 10). All three methods produce nearly the same result, a result good enough to encourage increasing popularity of this major Simple Moving Average (SMA): Moving Arithmetic Mean 645 Example of Simple Moving Average of Four Periods Four-Period Four-Period Price Moving Simple Moving NYSE Total Average Year End Close (T) (T 4) 1968 58.90 1969 51.53 1970 50.23 1971 56.43 217.09 54.27 1972 64.48 222.67 55.67 1973 51.82 222.96 55.74 1974 36.13 208.86 52.22 1975 47.64 200.07 50.02 1976 57.88 193.47 48.37 1977 52.50 194.15 48.54 1978 53.62 211.64 52.91 1979 61.95 225.95 56.49 1980 77.86 245.93 61.48 1981 71.11 264.54 66.14 1982 81.03 291.95 72.99 1983 95.18 325.18 81.30 1984 96.38 343.70 85.93 1985 121.58 394.17 98.54 1986 138.58 451.72 112.93 trend following indicator over the decades. Despite its simplicity, the SMA is a use- ful tool for identifying and following price trends and smoothing data of all kinds. Since only two prices affect the most recent SMA, updating the calculation can be accomplished quickly without a computer. For example, to maintain a 10-month SMA, at each month end, we would subtract the oldest data, now 11 months old, from our 10-month moving total. Then, we add the latest data to the moving total. Finally, we divide that new moving total by the number of periods averaged, which in this ex- ample of 10 periods simply involves placing the decimal point before the last digit of the moving total. Indicator Strategy Example for the Simple Moving Average (SMA) Based on the daily closing prices for the DJIA from 1900 to 2001, Simple Moving Average Crossover Strategies of all lengths from 1-day to 385 days would have been profitable and would have beaten the passive buy-and-hold strategy. The 1-, 4-, and 5-day SMA would have produced maximum net profits in the billions of dollars, 648 Technical Market Indicators assuming we start with one hundred dollars in 1900. Performance deteriorated as the moving average period length increased. All SMA period lengths of 1 to 100 days would have outperformed buy-and-hold by more than seven to one. Of the ‘interme- diate-term’ lengths, the 66-day SMA would have produced the best results, net profit of $639,933, which would have been more than 31 times the buy-and-hold strategy’s $20,105. The popular 200-day SMA Crossover Strategy would have produced much less profit of $121,257, which would have been only six times the buy-and-hold-strat- egy’s $20,105 net profit. Of the ‘long-term’ lengths, the 126-day SMA Crossover Strategy would have produced the maximum profit on a purely mechanical trend-following signal basis with no subjectivity, no sophisticated technical analysis, and no judgement: Enter Long (Buy) at the current daily price close of the DJIA when this close is greater than the previous day’s 126-day SMA of the daily closing prices. Close Long (Sell) at the current daily price close of the DJIA when this close is less than the previous day’s 126-day SMA of the daily closing prices. Enter Short (Sell Short) at the current daily price close of the DJIA when this close is less than the previous day’s 126-day SMA of the daily closing prices. Close Short (Cover) at the current daily price close of the DJIA when this close is greater than the previous day’s 126-day SMA of the daily closing prices. Starting with $100 and reinvesting profits, total net profits for this 126-day SMA Crossover Strategy would have been $426,745.59, assuming a fully invested strategy, reinvestment of profits, no transactions costs and no taxes. This would have been 2,022.54 percent better than buy-and-hold. Short selling would have been prof- itable, but not since the Crash of ’87. Trading frequency would have been moderate with one trade every 41.75 calendar days. There would have been 185 profitable trades and 701 losing trades, for a winning percentage of only 20.88% profitable. But because this trend-following strategy cuts losses and lets profits run, it would have made money despite being wrong on most of its signals. This is typical of the longer- term trend-following strategies. Such a strategy may be used alone, and it also can be useful as a filter to other trading systems. The Equis International MetaStock® System Testing rules are written as follows: Enter long: CLOSE > Ref(Mov(CLOSE,opt1,S),-1) Close long: CLOSE < Ref(Mov(CLOSE,opt1,S),-1) Speed Resistance Lines 653 Speed Resistance Lines Speed Resistance Lines provide theoretical support and resistance. They were devel- oped by Edson Gould, who published a technical analysis newsletter, Findings & Forecasts, which achieved great popularity and a wide following in the 1970s, thanks to a number of startlingly accurate market calls. Gould was educated as an engineer, and he used his knowledge, long experience, and intuition to conceptualize structures of market movements. Gould viewed market movements as the meaningful unfolding of underlying significant forces of accumulation and distribution. Speed Resistance Lines move at a fraction of the pace of the preceding signifi- cant market price move. Rising Speed Resistance Lines move up at rates of speed that are one-third and two-thirds the rate of a previous notable advance from a significant low to a significant high. Falling Speed Resistance Lines move down at rates of speed that are one-third and two-thirds the rate of a previous notable decline from a signif- icant high to a significant low. There are few turning points a year that really stand out on the chart, and these are the significant highs and lows. To compute Rising Speed Resistance Lines, subtract the price at an outstanding low from the price at a subsequent important rally peak. Divide that difference into thirds. Add one-third and then two-thirds to the original low. On an arithmetically scaled chart, directly below and on the exact date of the outstanding rally peak, mark these two calculated points, at one-third and two-thirds of the total rally advance in price, from low to high. Draw straight lines from the low through these two points. These straight lines are the One-Third and Two-Thirds Speed Resistance Lines. The procedure is similar for falling Speed Resistance Lines, which are drawn down from a high through points one-third and two-thirds the distance above a subsequent low. 654 Technical Market Indicators For downside corrections or reactions against a strong bullish trend, price should find support at the rising Two-Thirds Speed Resistance Line. If that support fails, however, price may then fall to the One-Third Speed Resistance Line, where it should find support. The chart shows that the Rising One-Third Speed Resistance Line from the 1982 low to the 1987 high provided precise support in the Crash of ’87. The related rising Two-Thirds Speed Resistance Line provided six years of guidance reminiscent of a median line on the subsequent rising trend from 1988 to 1994. In a bear market, oversold rallies and dead cat bounces should find resistance at the falling Two-Thirds Resistance Speed Line. If that resistance fails to stop the price recovery, however, price may then rise up to the One-Third Speed Resistance Line, where it should find resistance. Note that MetaStock® software by Equis International (www.equis.com) also automatically draws a Three-Thirds Speed Resistance Line from low to high (or from high to low). This is not discussed much but appears to be interesting at times when extended out into the future. The 3/3, Three-Thirds Speed Resistance Line drawn from the 1982 low to the 1983 high was never exceeded but was fairly closely ap- proached at the end of the steep bull market that ended in March 2000. Also, note that the 3/3, Three-Thirds Speed Resistance Line drawn from the December 1994 low to the May 1996 high seemed to provid structure to the subsequent bullish trend. Springboard A Springboard occurs when price breaks out above or below a resistance or support level but immediately reverses with a forceful move in the opposite direction. This hooks or traps trend-followers who went with the breakout. These trend-followers must now cut losses, which adds fuel to the new directional momentum. Stage Analysis Stage Analysis is a term coined by Stan Weinstein (See Weinstein, S. (1988). Stan We- instein’s Secrets for Profiting in Bull and Bear Markets. Homewood, IL: Irwin) to de- scribe his observation that stocks pass through four stages in their complete bull through bear cycle. Stage 1 is base-building, characterized by the stock price fluctuating sideways in a relatively narrow trading range. There is little interest in the stock and nothing seems to be happening. Something important is happening, however, and that is ac- cumulation by the smart-money investors with the vision to see better things ahead. Volume has been light but begins to improve on rallies. In Stage 1, the stock price wanders aimlessly back and forth across its own trailing 50-day, 150-day, and 656 Technical Market Indicators 200-day moving averages. This is not the time for trend trading, since the whipsaws would eat into your capital. Stage 1 can drag out for many months or even years, so for the technical trader it is too early to buy. But the longer Stage 1 lasts, the greater the upside potential in the next Stage 2. Stage 2 sees a breakout and a substantial price mark-up. The price moves above all moving averages and makes new 52-week highs. Volume jumps up on the break- out, rises on rallies, and falls on price dips. The moving averages are rising now. Cor- rective Secondary Waves or shake-outs temporarily may drop the stock below its own trailing 50-day moving average but not for long, as price springs back up quickly. The trailing 150-day and 200-day moving averages provide support on normal contra- trend reactions, periods of profit taking. Fundamental conditions begin to improve in Stage 2. Everyone is making money except the short sellers. It is a Bull Market. Stage 3 is the top. The fundamental news is very positive and everyone is talk- ing bullish. The stock price stalls out, however, and no longer responds to good news. Volume is high, but there is a seller for every buyer. Price slides sideways through ris- ing trendlines. A potentially bearish chart pattern forms. Price begins to cross back and forth through the various moving averages. Toward the end of Stage 3, everyone who is going to buy has already bought, so the price has only one way to go, down. Stage 4 is the breakdown followed by a major decline. The stock price drops be- low its Stage 3 trading range and below its own trailing 50-day, 150-day, and 200-day moving averages. These moving averages are pointing lower now, declining, and they provide resistance on normal contra-trend rallies, periods of short covering. In the early part of Stage 4, the fundamentals still look good, but the stock price fails to re- spond to good news or rallies only very briefly before declining again. As Stage 4 progresses, fundamentals begin to turn negative. At that point, everyone wants out, and the decline steepens. There may be a series of selling panics and selling climaxes on high volume as investors turn fearful. The decline usually goes further than any- one thought possible, until the stock is extremely oversold and undervalued. Eventu- ally, everyone who is going to sell has already sold, and so the stock no longer drops to new lows on bad news. The crowd has been badly burned and consequently is to- tally disgusted with the stock, muttering, ‘Never again.’ At this point, the stage is set for an eventual new round of accumulation, and a new Stage 1 may begin, though that probably will take time. Statistics 657 Standard Deviation Standard deviation is a statistical measurement of data dispersion, or scatter, or volatility. It is a quantification of the variability of the distribution of the raw data around a simple moving average. Standard deviation is calculated in six steps: 1. Compute a simple average of the raw data over the relevant time interval se- lected, by summing the observed values and then dividing by the total num- ber of observations. 2. Compute the differences between each observation (the raw data for each time period) and the average of all observations (from the first step). 3. 4. Compute the squares of these differences. Sum the squares of the differences. 5. Divide this sum of squares by the number of observations to arrive at the variance. 6. Calculate the square root of this variance to arrive at the standard deviation, a quantification of the variability of the distribution of the raw data around the moving average. Standard deviation is symbolized by the Greek letter sigma, . In many practi- cal applications it is worth knowing whether the data points are clustered tightly around the mean or dispersed widely over a range and by how much. If the standard deviation is small, the individual data points are tightly clustered around the mean. But if the standard deviation is large, the individual data points are widely scattered around the mean. (See Bollinger Bands, for an example of a popular technical indi- cator that uses standard deviation.) Statistics The technical indicators in this book are simple mathematical models. Being simple, they are easy to understand, compute, and implement. Simplicity is a very important criterion for selecting an investment method. A mathematical model is simply an idealized representation of reality in the form of a clearly defined formula, or more than one formula combined into a ‘sys- tem.’ Fortunately, though perhaps counter-intuitively, simple models actually work better than complex systems. If we can’t understand it, we won’t use it. Technical analysts have long used simple statistics. There is no evidence that ad- vanced, complex statistics work any better than the simplest statistics. In fact, expe- rience strongly suggests that the opposite is true, that simple statistics work better than advanced and complex statistics. 658 Technical Market Indicators Technicians use moving averages more than any other statistic. Moving aver- ages are simple and easy-to-understand mathematical measures of the underlying trend. Raw market data can be noisy, and technical analysts recognized decades ago that moving averages can smooth the data enough to reveal the trend. Moving aver- ages of the daily closing price reliably follow the price trend. Also, they often provide support and resistance. Traditionally, for many decades, technicians have used moving averages cover- ing windows of time of the past 10 months, 10 weeks, and 10 days to identify and fol- low long-, intermediate-, and short-term trends. To calculate a 10-period simple moving average, we simply add together the daily closing prices over the past 10 pe- riods then divide that sum by 10. Curiously, ten months is slightly more than 200 trad- ing days, which is the most popular moving average of the long-term, major trend. The computer can quickly add together the daily closing prices over the past 200 days and divide that sum by 200 to find the 200-day simple moving average. Then, if the current closing price is higher than the moving average, the long-term trend is as- sumed to be upward (bullish) and the financial instrument in question is a buy candi- date. On the other hand, if the current closing price is lower than the 200-day moving average, then the main trend is downward (bearish) and the instrument is a sell can- didate. Using simple moving averages covering all three time frames (10 months, 10 weeks, and 10 days) together offers confirmation and other advantages. (See Multiple Time Frame Analysis.) Some technical indicators use the variability of the distribution of the data around the moving average. Sometimes, it may seem significant to know whether the data points are clustered tightly around the mean or dispersed widely over a range. The standard deviation is simply the square root of the mean of the squares of the de- viations. In other words, we calculate the difference of each observed data point mi- nus the mean or average of the recent past data points, we square these differences, then we divide these squared numbers by the number of observations under consid- eration (which is symbolized by the letter n). This standard deviation is traditionally designated by a forbidding Greek letter, sigma, but it is actually a very simple con- cept. If the standard deviation is small, the individual data points are tightly clustered around the mean. But if the standard deviation is large, the individual data points are widely scattered around the mean. The variance is simply the square of the standard deviation. Correlation is a measure of relatedness. When two data series increase or de- crease proportionately and simultaneously, they are correlated positively. A perfect positive correlation results in a coefficient of 1. At the opposite extreme, if one data series increases in the same proportion that the other decreases, the two are negatively correlated. A perfect negative correlation produces a coefficient of 1. A total ab- sence of correlation would be a coefficient of 0. Intermediate values are interpreted STIX: The Polymetric Short-term Indicator 659 by degree. A high positive correlation would be 0.75. A high negative correlation would be 0.75. A low positive correlation would be 0.25. A low negative correlation would be 0.25. There are also tests of reliability designed to tell us whether an indicator is valid or not. Statisticians have devised several tests for the significance or reliability of data. One we refer to in this book is the chi-square test. Here, the deviations (observed indicator values minus expected random values) are squared, divided by the expected values, and summed. The value of chi-square is then compared with values in a stan- dard statistical table to determine the significance of the deviations. Back testing an indicator using substantial historical data going back many years yields a clear simulated record of buy and sell signals and a Cumulative Equity Curve. This curve can be compared against the record of the passive Buy-and-Hold Strategy. If the curve shows greater profit with less risk (that is, less negative vari- ability, or fewer large losses), then it is clear that the indicator adds value to the in- vestment decision making process. Usually, this will be obvious by simple visual inspection of the chart of Cumulative Equity versus the unmanaged underlying secu- rity. No number crunching is required. Taking the time to learn to comfortably read charts pays unexpected dividends in being able to grasp the meaning of data in more powerful and insightful ways than any abstract statistic possibly could reveal. Experienced technical analysts develop a strong sense of statistical significance by simply inspecting a graph of the actual data. It is an art well worth cultivating. STIX: The Polymetric Short-term Indicator STIX is an exponentially smoothed, breadth-momentum oscillator developed by The Polymetric Report. A 9% (or 21-day) exponential smoothing constant applied to the number of advancing issues divided by the sum of the number of advancing issues plus the number of declining issues. STIX is usually calculated based on issues listed on the New York Stock Exchange, and similar indicators may be calculated for other markets, such as the NASDAQ. STIX may be expressed by the following formula: S ( ( ( A / ( A D ) ) * 0.09 ) ( P * 0.91 ) where S today’s STIX A number of advancing issues D number of declining issues P previous day’s STIX 660 Technical Market Indicators STIX is usually multiplied by 100 to avoid dealing with fractions. STIX oscil- lates around a perfectly balanced number of 50, where advances and declines are equal. One may start calculating STIX with an initial value of 50 at any point in time, ideally after a sideways market trend, although STIX will be accurate within a few weeks no matter when it is started. Record ranges for STIX are from 28 to 69, low to high, both set in 1932. Tradi- tionally, high levels above 58 were thought to indicate strong bullish breadth mo- mentum, while low levels below 40 indicated bearish momentum. As the graph shows, however, breadth volatility has diminished in recent years, producing no sig- nals for STIX based on thresholds of 40 and 58. Trends, comparative levels, and divergences in STIX have been interpreted rel- ative to a market price index in typical oscillator fashion. For example, a positive di- vergence in STIX on a re-test of previous price index lows is generally thought to indicate a diminishing imbalance of supply over demand, and that may be a bullish leading indicator of the short-term trend. On the other hand, a negative divergence in STIX on a re-test of previous price index highs indicates a diminishing imbalance of demand over supply, and that is a bearish leading indicator of the short-term trend. Indicator Strategy Example for STIX Based on a 68-year file of daily data for the number of shares advancing and declin- ing each day on the NYSE and the DJIA since March 8, 1932, we found that a simple trend-following rule would have produced a positive result on a purely mechanical signal basis with no subjectivity, no sophisticated technical analysis, and no judgement: Enter Long (Buy) at the current daily price close of the DJIA when STIX crosses above 49. Close Long (Sell) at the current daily price close of the DJIA when STIX crosses below 49. Enter Short (Sell Short) at the current daily price close of the DJIA when STIX crosses below 49. Close Short (Cover) at the current daily price close of the DJIA when STIX crosses above 49. Starting with $100 and reinvesting profits, total net profits for this STIX trend- following strategy would have been $240,013.89 , assuming a fully invested strategy, reinvestment of profits, no transactions costs and no taxes. This would have been 1,814.19 percent better than buy-and-hold. Even short selling would have been STIX: The Polymetric Short-term Indicator 661 profitable. Trading would have been fairly active with one trade every 16.35 calendar days. The Equis International MetaStock® System Testing rules, where one hundred times the ratio of advances divided by the sum of advances plus declines is inserted into the data field normally reserved for Volume (V), are written as follows: Enter long: Mov(V,opt1,E)>opt2 AND Ref( Mov(V,opt1,E),-1)<opt2 Close long: Mov(V,opt1,E)<opt3 AND Ref( Mov(V,opt1,E),-1)>opt3 Enter short: Mov(V,opt1,E)<opt3 AND Ref( Mov(V,opt1,E),-1)>opt3 Close short: Mov(V,opt1,E)>opt2 AND Ref( Mov(V,opt1,E),-1)<opt2 OPT1 Current value: 21 OPT2 Current value: 49 OPT3 Current value: 49 664 Technical Market Indicators Stochastics (Lane’s Stochastics) In statistics, the term ‘stochastic’ refers to random variables. But that is the opposite of what George Lane has in mind. Lane’s Stochastics is a short-term price velocity in- dicator, precisely defined and successfully popularized by George C. Lane (Invest- ment Educators, PO Box 2354, Des Plaines, IL). Because Stochastics is based on a fixed period-to-period moving calculation that can jump around erratically due solely to data for the oldest period being dropped off the calculation as the data window (pe- riod of predefined length) moves forward in time, Lane’s Stochastics is twice smoothed by moving averages. Lane’s Stochastics may be calculated, as follows: K 100 ((C L) / (H L)) where K the location of the current price relative to the recent price range. C the latest closing price of the stock or contract. L the n-period low price of the stock or contract. H the n-period high price of the stock or contract. n can be any number (Lane suggests 5 to 21 days). Next, Lane smoothes K twice with 3-period simple moving averages: his %K is the 3-period simple moving average of K, and %D is the 3-period simple moving av- erage of %K. After smoothing the data, K has no further use. Only the %K and %D lines are used for interpretation of signals. Lane offers several guidelines for interpretation of Stochastics, including over- bought/oversold preconditions, divergences, and crossovers. First, consider buy sig- nals. In a downward price move, a precondition for a buy signal is recognized when %K becomes oversold below 25%. It is more significant when %K is extremely over- sold below 15%. Note that these are only preconditions and not signals for action. After an oversold precondition has been achieved, look for a positive diver- gence. When price moves down to a new low but the already oversold %K does not make a new low, this is a positive divergence, and we should be on alert for an upturn in the price trend. The actual buy signal comes when %K crosses above %D. Lane says that the buy signal is more reliable when %D has already turned up when %K crosses above %D. If the slower %D has been quietly carving out a pattern of higher lows as price makes lower lows, that is all the more reason to look for a buying op- portunity on the next decline. Considering sell signals, in a upward price move, a precondition for a sell sig- nal is recognized when %K becomes overbought above 75%. It is more significant when %K is extremely overbought above 85%. Note that these are only preconditions and not signals for action. Stochastics (Lane’s Stochastics) 665 After an overbought precondition has been achieved, look for a negative diver- gence. When price moves up to a new high but the already overbought %K does not make a new high, this is a negative divergence, and we should be on alert for a down- turn in the price trend. The actual sell signal comes when %K crosses below %D. Lane says that the sell signal is more reliable when %D has already turned down when %K crosses below %D. If the slower %D has been quietly carving out a pattern of lower highs as price makes higher highs, that is all the more reason to look for a selling opportunity on the next rally. Lane finds additional significance in failures. For example, following an over- bought precondition, when %K has already crossed under %D, then %K rallies again and re-approaches %D, but %K fails to cross above %D, that is a good time to enter a trade on the short side. Similarly, after a price drop to an oversold precondition and a minor upward price reaction causing %K to cross above %D, when %K falls again and re-ap- proaches %D, but %K fails to cross under %D, that is a good time to enter a trade on the long side. Lane analyzes the velocity of the %K and %D lines, and finds implications of trend change. A warning is given when %K makes an extreme turn and an unusually large move. This indicates at most two days remaining in the old trend. When velocity slows, that is, when the speed of either the %K or %D lines flat- tens out, it indicates a price reversal on the next day. Lane calls this a hinge. Lane says reliability is enhanced when %K is in an extreme overbought or over- sold zone: for buy signals, %K is extremely oversold below 15%; for sell signals, %K is extremely overbought above 85%. The most extreme %K levels near 100% and 0% indicate unusually powerful price velocity that is likely to continue in the prevailing trend direction. At times, %K can be nailed to 100% or 0% for many consecutive days in a strong move. Only after %K pulls back, tries again, but then fails to achieve its previous extreme reading does Lane recognize a worthwhile overbought/oversold precondition for a signal. It is most important to note that Lane considers signals to be more reliable when they are in the same direction as the major trend. This implies that short-term Sto- chastics could be used with major trend indicators to filter its signals. Indicator Strategy Example for Stochastics Stochastics require experience and judgement to use as George Lane intended. His guidelines are too complex for simple computer testing. Still, even naïve testing as- sumptions suggest that Stochastics may have value as a purely mechanical indicator. Our tests found a majority of profitable signals, and results would have been robust for all %K period lengths from 4 to 50 days. 666 Technical Market Indicators As attractive as a high percentage of profitable trades may seem, however, it is important to note that this and other contra-trend strategies failed to provide any pro- tection in the Crash of ’87, the decline of 1998 and other steep market price drops. As the chart shows, there are sharp equity drawdowns. Using Stochastics for contra-trend oversold and overbought signals would have outperformed the passive buy-and-hold strategy for long trades only. Short selling would not have been profitable in the past. Based on a merged file of adjusted daily data for the entire history of the S&P 500 Stock Index Futures CSI Perpetual Contract (www.csidata.com) from inception on 4/21/82 to 5/10/01, and cash S&P 500 Stock Price Index from 11/28/80 to 4/21/82, we found that the following parameters would have produced a significantly positive result on a counter-trend, mechanical overbought/oversold signal basis with no sub- jectivity, no sophisticated technical analysis, and no judgement: Enter Long (Buy) at the current daily price close of the S&P 500 Stock Index Futures CSI Perpetual Contract when %K Stochastic (with K equal to seven days, and smoothed by a 3-day SMA) is less than 30. Close Long (Sell) at the current daily price close of the S&P 500 Stock In- dex Futures CSI Perpetual Contract when %K Stochastic (with K equal to seven days, and smoothed by a 3-day SMA) is greater than 70. Enter Short (Sell Short) at the current daily price close of the S&P 500 Stock Index Futures CSI Perpetual Contract when %K Stochastic (with K equal to seven days, and smoothed by a 3-day SMA) is greater than 70. Close Short (Cover) at the current daily price close of the S&P 500 Stock Index Futures CSI Perpetual Contract when %K Stochastic (with K equal to seven days, and smoothed by a 3-day SMA) is less than 30. Starting with $100 and reinvesting profits, total net profits for this Stochastics counter-trend strategy would have been $1,215.35, assuming a fully invested strategy, reinvestment of profits, no transactions costs and no taxes. This would have been 52.12 percent greater than buy-and-hold. Short selling would have been slightly un- profitable, and short selling was included in this strategy. This long-and-short Sto- chastics as an indicator would have given profitable buy signals 70.64% of the time. Trading would have been active at one trade every 13.70 calendar days. Note that this counter-trend, overbought/oversold strategy would have suffered large equity draw- downs, the worst down 36% in the Crash of ’87. 674 Technical Market Indicators Stochastic Pop Breakout: Popsteckle Technical analysts have invented alternate ways to use George Lane’s Stochastics. Jake Bernstein may have been the first to try buying rather than selling when Lane’s Stochastics rises to 70. Writing in the August 2000 issue of Technical Analysis of Stocks & Commodities magazine (800-832-4642, www.traders.com), David Steckler (www.dsteckler@aol.com) devised the following specific setup conditions, which he claims telegraph a rapid appreciation in the price of a stock: • Daily ADX below 20 (even better, below 15), indicating a non-trending market. (See Directional Movement.) ADX measures the strength of the re- cent trend, not its direction, up or down. • Daily Stochastics %K above 70 (even better above 80) and rising. Set %K to a 3-period SMA of the raw ratio, K, which is set to 8 days. • Weekly Stochastics %K above 50 and rising. Again, set %K to a 3-period SMA of the raw ratio, K, which is set to 8 weeks. • Stock price breakout (see Price Channel), on above-average volume, with volume greater than a 50-day SMA of volume. Wait for the stock to trade higher than the recent congestion-range high, with higher volume on the breakout. • Bullish market conditions, indicated by an appropriate general market price index and/or industry group price index trading above a trailing 50-day SMA or above a 20-day EMA for two consecutive trading days. • Use an appropriate exit strategy and a money management methodology that works best with your trading style. Stock Market Price Indexes Price indexes are important for judging trends and measuring performance for the stock market in general. And, thanks to innovations over the past two decades, we can now buy and sell futures, options, trusts, and mutual funds constructed to match many of the most popular indexes. These new financial instruments are useful for specula- tors who want to ‘play the market’ but do not have the time to conduct research on individual stocks. Indexes also offer the advantage of diversification over a large number of stocks, which reduces risk. The oldest and most popular indexes are those published by Dow Jones & Co. Founder Charles Dow published his first market average on July 3, 1884, in his Cus- tomer’s Afternoon Letter, the predecessor to The Wall Street Journal. This first group of stocks was comprised of 11 stocks, 9 railroads and 2 industrials. Stock Market Price Indexes 675 On May 26, 1896, Dow published his first Dow Jones Industrial Average (also commonly referred to as the Dow or the DJIA), composed solely of 12 Industrials. On October 1, 1928, the Dow was expanded to 30 stocks, and it has remained at that number ever since. The component stocks have changed many times over the years, however, because of mergers, bankruptcies, and companies and whole industries ris- ing and falling in economic power. The publisher tries to maintain a current list of 30 of the largest and most important blue-chip stocks. The only two names recognizable today from 1928 are General Electric and General Motors. Given current trends to- ward increasingly competitive financial capitalism and accelerating technological change, we might expect even more frequent changes of component stock issues in years ahead. The current list of stocks included in the Dow Averages can be found each day on page C3 of The Wall Street Journal. For all practical purposes, the DJIA is remarkably representative of the general market. The 30 Dow stocks comprise only about 15% of the total market value of all U.S. stocks. Critics have long doubted that such a small sample could adequately rep- resent the whole stock market, which is comprised of many thousands of stocks. And it is obvious that the Dow and the broader market sometimes go their separate ways for a while. Also, in the words of Arthur A. Merrill, CMT, a professional statistician as well as an expert technical market analyst, ‘Statisticians wince when they learn the weighting method’ of the Dow-Jones averages. The arithmetic price average is price weighted, so a $100 stock has 10 times the influence of a $10 stock. Worse, if a stock splits two-for-one, its weight immediately drops in half. Finally, substitutions of stocks in the averages also have detracted from comparability of the averages to themselves over time. But despite these reasonable criticisms, statistics clearly show that the Dow Averages reflect the trends of the broad market very closely. Looking at it with a microscope, we have noticed over the years a somewhat greater number of false signals (misleading breakouts and breakdowns) with the DJIA than with the better constructed indexes such as the Standard & Poor’s or NYSE composites. In fact, when the DJIA diverges from the S&P 500, the DJIA is usually the one that proves to be wrong. That is why most technical analysts chart more than one general price index. The Dow-Jones Transportation and Utility Averages suffer from the same weak- nesses as the DJIA—price weighting, splits, substitutions, and small sample size (only 20 transportation stocks and 15 utilities). Takeover speculation in only one or two transportation equities can have a significant effect on the average. In 1980, when energy stocks were dominating the market, most of the utility average’s movements were directly attributable to four natural gas stocks, rather than the staid electric util- ity equities most people think of when they consider the utility average. Contrary to popular opinion, we’ve found that the Dow-Jones Transportation Average is not a reliable leading indicator for the general market. But the Dow-Jones 676 Technical Market Indicators Utility Average is a fairly reliable leading indicator more often than not, although the lead may be long and variable. The broad-based, capitalization-weighted Standard & Poor’s (S&P) indexes and NYSE price indexes are measures of total market value. The most recent price of the hundreds of component stocks are multiplied by the number of shares outstanding. This product is then divided by a base date index number to make the index compa- rable over time. Splits have no impact, and substitutions of stocks are properly han- dled by adjusting the base date index number. Thus, valid and comparable market price data are available all the way back to 1873 for the S&P 500. The NYSE Composite (symbol NYA) is composed of all 2,800 common stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The NYA includes about 82% of the total market value of all U.S. stocks. The S&P Composite Index of the 500 biggest stocks (symbol SPX) is a subset of the NYSE Composite, and it comprises about 65% of the total market value of all U.S. stocks. The S&P 100 (OEX) index, used as the market index for a Chicago Board Options Exchange contract, is a subset of the S&P 500, listing the 100 largest stocks. As one might guess, there is a near perfect correlation between these capitalization-weighted indexes, all of which have the bulk of their weight in the 100 largest stocks. The NASDAQ Composite (symbol COMP) is composed of 5500 unlisted stocks traded over-the-counter, and it comprises about 18% of the total market value of all U.S. stocks. The NASDAQ Technology Stock Index of 700 stocks is a subset of the COMP, and it comprises about 37% of the total market value of the COMP. NASDAQ stands for the National Association of Securities Dealers Automatic Quo- tation system. The American Stock Exchange (AMEX) Market Value Index is properly capi- talization weighted, but its entire capitalization does not match that of only one stock, IBM, so its significance is minuscule. Moreover, only 10 stocks account for about one third of the AMEX total weight, so price distortions are possible. Few technical ana- lysts follow the AMEX index. The Russell 3000 stock index is composed of 3000 common stocks, and it com- prises about 98% of the total market value of all U.S. stocks. A subset, the Russell 1000 stock index, is the top third of the 3000 in terms of market capitalization. The Russell 1000 comprises about 90% of the total market value of the Russell 3000. The Russell 2000 stock index, which is the bottom two-thirds of the Russell 3000 in mar- ket capitalization, comprises about 10% of the total market value of the Russell 3000. The Wilshire 5000 stock index is the most broadly based, capitalization- weighted index, comprising almost all of the total market value of all U.S. stocks. Originally composed of 5000 stocks, this index now covers approximately 7,000 U.S. equities, including all actively trading common stocks on the New York Stock Ex- change, American Stock Exchange, and NASDAQ over-the-counter dealer market. Stock Market Price Indexes 677 The Value Line Averages are unweighted geometric averages of 1665 stocks. The smallest stock has the same impact as the largest. According to Norman G. Fos- back, in his 1976 book Stock Market Logic (Institute for Econometric Research, 3471 North Federal Highway, Fort Lauderdale, FL 33306), the geometric averaging method (based on logarithms) results in a negative, downward bias, so that the geo- metric average is always below the simple arithmetic average or mean. We have not found the Value Line composite useful in our technical work. Fosback is also critical of the advance-decline line as a market barometer, for three very good reasons. First, no consideration is given to the extent of price or mar- ket value change, but only to the direction of price change, up or down. Academic studies have proven that average price advances are larger than average price de- clines, so the advance-decline line’s failure to take into account the size of any price change means that the advance-decline must underperform the stock market price in- dexes, which it does. Second, the number of listed stocks has increased over the years, thus destroying the comparability of the advance-decline line over time. (This can be adjusted for by dividing advances minus declines by advances plus declines or by total issues traded.) Third, inclusion of preferred stocks, which fluctuate more with bond prices than with common stock prices, produces distortions, particularly when bond prices and common stock prices are trending in opposite directions, as they of- ten have in the past. Given these substantial shortcomings, false divergences in the advance-decline line versus price indexes become more understandable. On the positive side, Fosback holds unweighted total return indexes in high re- gard. These are based on Quotron’s ‘QCHA,’ which is the average percentage price change for each common stock listed on the NYSE. Including dividend return as well as percentage price change gives a more realistic overall representation, according to Fosback, because more than half of the long-term total return of all common stocks through history has been from dividends. Although Fosback has made a good case for unweighted, total return indexes, they still do not enjoy wide popularity. For one thing, the big institutions have diffi- culty trading large dollar amounts of small capitalization stocks, so they mostly stay with the big, high-capitalization stocks that dominate the S&P 500. Thus, they focus on that index. For another thing, unweighted total return indexes are not widely pub- lished in the popular press, and few people choose to spend the time necessary to make their own calculations. In conclusion, like most technical researchers, we prefer the broad-based, capi- talization-weighted indexes for our technical studies, specifically the S&P 500 or NYSE Composite, which for practical purposes are nearly the same. We use the Dow for many studies for the very practical reason that we happen to have the most daily data in computer readable form (back to 1900) for the Dow. Finally, the weight of tra- dition favoring the DJIA is heavy and demands respect. 680 Technical Market Indicators for a downward price correction so they can reduce their losses and their psycholog- ical discomfort at being wrong. They will be willing buyers at 55, their break-even point. Also, bulls on the stock who did not short but did take profits at 55, feel re- morse at the potential profit they missed. These bulls also hope for a correction to 55, where they sold long, so they can undo their painful mistake and get another chance to reestablish their long positions. Thus, both groups, the bulls and the bears, will be bidding for the stock at 55, providing price support. Swing Filter A major challenge to traders is how to deal with noise in the data generated by free markets. There are many conceptually related techniques that attempt to filter out mi- nor price movements, or ripples in Dow Theory terminology. Some simply ignore price movements less than a certain minimum size. The Point and Figure Charting method is an ancient and well-known example of such a filter. Swing Filter is a simple idea: examine each high and low and filter out price re- versals under a minimum percentage size. For example, some stock market analysts filter out and (thus ignore) movements of less than 3% or 4% or 8%. This cuts down on the amount of data to be considered, simplifying the decision-making process. The idea is that if we can cut out some of the minor noise, we can reduce the confusion and better focus on the main trend. The optimal size of the filter can be determined by back testing. A good example of a Swing Filter is a slightly asymmetrical rule developed more than 12 years ago by Ned Davis Research. Buy the S&P 500 Index when it rises from an extreme closing price low by 8.4%. Hold long until the S&P 500 Index falls from an extreme closing price high by 7.2%, then sell long positions and switch into Commercial Paper. This simple filter would have given profitable signals 63% of the time, for long trades only. It would have outperformed a passive buy-and-hold strat- egy by 44.2% from 1969 to 1998, as the chart shows. This Swing Filter rule is always on the right side of the big price moves, has a built-in, loss-cutting stop loss point, and has an average gain four times larger than its average loss. 682 Technical Market Indicators Swing Index (Wilder’s) Wilder’s Swing Index (SI) is a complex trend-confirmation/divergence indicator pub- lished by J. Welles Wilder, Jr., in his 1978 book, New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems (Trend Research, PO Box 128, McLeansville, NC 27301). Wilder designed SI to be a better representation of the true market trend. SI compares relationships be- tween the current prices (open, high, low, and close) and the previous period’s prices. Mathematically, SI may be expressed as follows: SI ( ( 50 * K ) / M ) * ((C Cp) .5 (C O) .25(Cp Op)) / R ) where K the larger of H Cp or L Cp. H the highest price of the current period. Cp the closing price of the previous period. L the lowest price of the current period. M the value of a limit move set by the futures exchange. C the closing price of the current period. O the opening price of the current period. Op the opening price of the previous period. R is defined by the following two steps: Step 1: Determine which is the largest of the following three values: H Cp, or L Cp, or H L. Step 2: Calculate R according to one of following three formulas: If the largest value in Step 1 is H Cp, then R (H Cp) .5( L C) .25(Cp Op). If the largest value in Step 1 is L Cp, then R (L Cp) .5( H C) .25(Cp Op). If the largest value in Step 1 is H L, then R (H L) .25(Cp Op). Swing Retracement Levels 683 Stocks do not have daily price movement limits. Therefore, when using MetaStock® software, we use the maximum number of 30,000 for the ‘limit move parameter.’ The SI data can be plotted as an oscillator viewed with a variety of technical analysis methods. It is most productively viewed as the Accumulation Swing Index (ASI), which is a cumulative running total of the Swing Index. (See Accumulation Swing Index.) Swing Retracement Levels This Swing Retracement method subtracts the extreme low from the extreme high of any significant swing (price range), multiplies that difference by certain customary numbers long used by the trading community, then adds these products to the extreme low and subtracts them from the extreme high. The results are useful price targets as well as support and resistance levels. W. D. Gann divided a price range into eighths: 0.125, 0.25, 0.375, 0.5, 0.625, 0.75, 0.875, and 1. Gann also projected whole number integer multiples of a price range: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, etc. Gann marked off squares of integers: 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 144, etc. Gann also used the range from the extreme high price down to zero. And independent of any past prices, Gann noted round numbers, especially those followed by zeros. The most important Fibonacci ratios to multiply the past price ranges by are: 0.236, 0.382, 0.500, 0.618, 0.786, 1.000, 1.272, 1.618, 2.000, 2.618, and 4.236. Dow Theorists emphasize thirds, that is, 0.333 and 0.667. Tubb’s Law of Proportion emphasizes common fractions, 1/2 or 0.5, 2/3 or 0.667, and 3/4 or 0.75, as the most important ratios. This Swing Retracement method also may be applied to time intervals between swing highs and lows. For example, if a price upswing lasted 100 calendar days, from the date of the price low to the date of the price high, we might look for a downward price correction of that up-move to terminate at or near the following Fibonacci num- bers of days from the top, rounded to whole numbers: 24, 38, 50, 62, 79, 100, 127, 162, 200, 262, and 424 calendar days. Finally, to cover all bases, we could mark off the thirds, 33 and 66 days, and all the Gann numbers. To the uninitiated, unaware of the market’s hidden structures, this exercise may seem arbitrary and illogical at first. But many experienced traders employ Swing Re- tracement because it often helps them determine in advance potential price levels and time junctures at which to be especially alert for price-trend change. They use these dates and price levels in conjunction with other technical indicators to pinpoint trend changes that otherwise would be impossible to identify. On occasion, they hit a future turning point with uncanny accuracy. 684 Technical Market Indicators Taylor Book Method The Taylor Book Method is a short-term, contrary, trend-fading strategy that attempts to capitalize on an observed tendency of the markets to move in price ripples of about 3 days in one direction before reversing. Basically, after three down days, look to buy any early weakness at or near the opening. If the market is not weak early, postpone action by a day. Look to take profits near previous daily highs. Conversely, after three up days, look to short any early strength at or near the opening. If the market is not strong early, postpone action by a day. Look to take profits near previous daily lows. Positions are closed out in one to 3 days. (See Taylor, George Douglas, The Taylor Trading Technique, 1950, Traders Press, PO Box 6206, Greenville, SC 29606, www.traderspressbookstore.com.) TEMA (See Triple Exponential Moving Averages.) Three Line Break Charts The Japanese Three Line Break Chart is a unique kind of a line chart designed to fil- ter out minor, short-term market noise. It is named for the three line blocks used to construct the chart. This method considers closing prices only and ignores all intraday highs and lows. A new white block is added to the chart in a new column to the right when the high of the previous block is exceeded. A new black block is added when the current close breaks the low of the previous block, and this new black block is drawn in the next column to the right from the bottom of the previous block. When there is neither a new high or low, nothing is added and the chart remains the same. Thus, like the western Point and Figure Technique, price movement (and not the passage of time) determines the progress along the horizontal x-axis. Following a rally powerful enough to form three consecutive white blocks, a downside reversal is recognized only when the price falls below the lowest price of the most recent three consecutive white blocks. At that point, from the bottom of the highest white block, a black block is drawn down to this new price low. Following a sell-off powerful enough to form three consecutive black blocks, an upside reversal is recognized only when the price rises above the highest price of the most recent three consecutive black blocks. At that point, from the top of the lowest black block, a white block is drawn up to this new price high. The chart shows the Three Line Break Chart for the S&P Depositary Receipts (SPY) for the full year 2000, January through December, drawn with MetaStock® software. See Renko Chart to compare this chart to the similar 1 point box size Renko 686 Technical Market Indicators Chart and to the 1 point box size and 1 point reversal Point and Figure Chart for the same stock over the same time. Three Moving Average Crossover Three Moving Average Crossover is a combination indicator that uses three moving averages of different lengths to generate trading signals. It combines fast and slow moving average signals in one indicator. Buy when the slope of the fast moving av- erage is positive and the medium moving average is above the slow moving average. Sell when the slope of the fast moving average is negative and the medium moving average is below the slow moving average. One popular version uses 4-, 9-, and 18- trading days for the moving average lengths. These specific period lengths could be allowed to vary, of course, producing a very large number of possibilities. One possi- ble MetaStock® System Test could be expressed as follows: Enter long: Mov(CLOSE,opt1,E) > Ref(Mov(CLOSE,opt1,E),-1) AND Mov(CLOSE,2*opt1,E) > Mov(CLOSE,4*opt1,E) Close long: Mov(CLOSE,opt1,E) < Ref(Mov(CLOSE,opt1,E),-1) AND Mov(CLOSE,2*opt1,E) < Mov(CLOSE,4*opt1,E) Enter short: Mov(CLOSE,opt1,E) < Ref(Mov(CLOSE,opt1,E),-1) AND Mov(CLOSE,2*opt1,E) < Mov(CLOSE,4*opt1,E) Close short: Mov(CLOSE,opt1,E) > Ref(Mov(CLOSE,opt1,E),-1) AND Mov(CLOSE,2*opt1,E) > Mov(CLOSE,4*opt1,E) TICK TICK is a snapshot of the market’s trend at any specific time in the trading day. TICK reflects market strength (positive and rising) or weakness (negative and falling) at any moment during the trading day. TICK is the net difference between the number of NYSE stocks with their latest sales occurring on an uptick (a higher current price than the next most recent price) minus the number of NYSE stocks with last sales occur- ring on a downtick (a lower current price than the previous price). In essence, it is a moment-to-moment representation of net advancing issues, considering only the most recent price compared to the next most recent price. TICK oscillates around zero. It can be interpreted in standard oscillator fashion. Traders watch TICK to identify shifts in trends. When TICK goes from a large negative reading to a large positive reading, that indicates a bullish change in the mar- ket’s demand and supply balance. Similarly, an equally dramatic negative swing, from a big plus TICK to a big minus TICK, indicates a bearish change. TICK 687 Positive and negative divergences in TICK relative to an independent indicator, such as a market price index, indicate an impending price trend change. When TICK makes a series of lower highs while an independent market indicator makes higher highs, such a negative divergence warns of a possible bearish change in the prevail- ing trend. Similarly, when TICK makes a series of higher lows while an independent market indicator makes lower lows, such a positive divergence warns of a possible bullish change in the prevailing trend. Generally, extremely high TICK readings indicate extremely positive momen- tum and unusual market strength. Such a strong trend often continues until momen- tum starts to dissipate on rallies. Some very aggressive short-term professional traders fade extreme momentum, expecting a return to more normal conditions. Generally, counter-trend trading tactics are not appropriate for long-term investors. Extremely low TICK readings indicate unusual selling pressure. Again, it is risky to fade such momentum, but the best time to buck that negative trend is when there is a genuine Selling Climax on huge volume. Such a Selling Climax is often fol- lowed by an unsustainable Dead Cat Bounce that can be profitable for astute traders. TICK has larger implications beyond day trading. The last price of the day, the closing price, has long been regarded as the single most important price of the day. The daily tug of war between bulls and bears is settled at one price at the end of the fray. When all is said and done at day’s end, that closing price is where demand and supply balance. The close is a summary of the day’s activity. Technicians usually ap- ply various moving averages to closing TICK values to smooth out erratic move- ments and reveal any underlying trend. (We added 10,000 to closing TICK to avoid the more complicated handling negative numbers, so our graph oscillates around 10,000.) Indicator Strategy Example for Closing TICK TICK is a robust indicator, with all exponential moving average lengths tested (from one to 500 days) profitable for long and short trades. The cumulative equity line shows few drawdown periods. Based on a 35-year file from January 1966 to January 2001 (TICK at the end of each day and the DJIA daily closing price) the following pa- rameters would have produced a positive result on a purely mechanical signal basis with no subjectivity, no sophisticated technical analysis, and no judgement: Enter Long (Buy) at the current daily price close of the DJIA when cur- rent closing TICK is greater than its own trailing 11-day exponential mov- ing average (EMA) as of the previous day, thereby signaling a rising trend of closing TICK. 690 Technical Market Indicators Close Long (Sell) at the current daily price close of the DJIA when current closing TICK is less than its own trailing 11-day EMA as of the previous day, thereby signaling a falling trend of closing TICK. Enter Short (Sell Short) at the current daily price close of the DJIA when current closing TICK is less than its own trailing 11-day EMA as of the previous day, thereby signaling a falling trend of closing TICK. Close Short (Cover) at the current daily price close of the DJIA when cur- rent closing TICK is greater than its own trailing 11-day EMA as of the previous day, thereby signaling a rising trend of closing TICK. Starting with $100 and reinvesting profits, total net profits for this TICK trend- following strategy would have been $129,613.94, assuming a fully invested strategy, reinvestment of profits, no transactions costs and no taxes. This would have been 12,905.09 percent greater than buy-and-hold. Short selling would have been prof- itable, and short selling was included in the strategy. Despite its high profitability, TICK would have been incorrect more often than it was right, with only 49.19% win- ning trades. Trading would have been hyperactive at one trade every 3.04 calendar days. The Equis International MetaStock® System Testing rules for closing TICK, where we added 10,000 to closing TICK and inserted it into the data field normally reserved for volume, are written as follows: Enter long: V > Ref(Mov(V,opt1,E),-1) Close long: V < Ref(Mov(V,opt1,E),-1) Enter short: V < Ref(Mov(V,opt1,E),-1) Close short: V > Ref(Mov(V,opt1,E),-1) OPT1 Current value: 11 Time Segmented Volume (TSV) 691 Tick Volume Bar A Tick Volume Bar is a bar chart with price on the vertical y-axis and n-tick intervals on the horizontal x-axis. Each price bar is defined by n number of ticks. For example, a tick volume bar of 10 would contain the price range measured over the past 10 transactions, a tick volume bar of 100 would contain the price range measured over the past 100 transactions, and so on. Time Segmented Volume (TSV) Time Segmented Volume (TSV) is a proprietary price and volume oscillator created by Don Worden (www.TC2000.com, Worden Brothers, Inc., 4950 Pine Cone Drive, Durham, North Carolina 27707, phone 800 776 4940). Worden typically uses an 18-, 26-, or 31-bar TSV; with the shorter the time period the more sensitive, and the longer the time period the less sensitive. Next, Worden smoothes this TSV data with an exponential moving average (of 13-days in his published example), which he over- lays on the TSV. Worden has observed that TSV works better for some stocks than others, so he evaluates past performance of TSV for each stock to see how well TSV applies on a case by case basis. TSV is interpreted much the same as any other oscillator: it is examined in a va- riety of ways to determine the relative balance of accumulation (buying) and distrib- ution (selling) and the implied potential for sustained directional price movement. • The oscillator is measured for its level relative to its own r ecent range, with high levels bullish and low levels bearish. • The relative levels of the oscillator are compared to the rela tive levels of the raw price data to determine any positive or negative divergences between the two. • The oscillator is compared to a critical threshold level, in t his case the zero line. Above the threshold is bullish. Below the threshold is bearish. • The oscillator’s own exponential moving average is compared to the critical threshold level. Above the threshold is bullish. Below the threshold is bear- ish. • The oscillator is compared to its own past trend, which in thi s case is de- fined by its own trailing exponential moving average. Above trend is bull- ish. Below trend is bearish. • In contrast to many oscillators, TSV is not used to determine o verbought and oversold levels. 692 Technical Market Indicators When these criteria line up on one side, bullish or bearish, the implications for action are clear, and the stock is bought or sold. When the criteria are mixed, subtle judgements are called for. Time Series Forecast (TSF), Moving Linear Regression, End Point Moving Average (EPMA) Time Series Forecast (TSF) is the ending value of a Linear Regression trendline plus its slope. The addition of slope extends the Linear Regression trendline forward in time by one trading day, offering a naïve forecast of the next day’s price. This as- sumes the trend continues in linear fashion (which it seldom does). TSF is designed to speed up trend change signals by reducing lag. TSF tracks the raw data more closely than Linear Regression trendlines or moving averages. The term ‘End Point Moving Average’ is a misnomer, strictly speaking, be- cause this indicator is not computed like a moving average. But Patrick E. Lafferty (‘The End Point Moving Average’, Technical Analysis of Stocks & Commodities, V13, pages 413–417, www.traders.com), correctly pointed out that this indicator could be interpreted much the same as moving averages. He suggested a buy signal when TSF moves up and the value of the DJIA is higher than the value of the TSF. He suggested a sell signal when TSF moves down and the value of the DJIA is lower than the value of the TSF. Total Issues Traded Total issues traded includes all of the issues that traded at all on any given day, in- cluding the total number of stocks ending the day higher, lower, and unchanged. On the NYSE, total issues traded rose 1080% from 1940 to 1999. Such growth distorts the meaning of breadth (advances, declines, new highs, and new lows) indicators over time. (See Number of Total Issues Traded.) Total Short Ratio The Total Short Ratio is calculated by dividing total short sales by total volume. Monthly NYSE data is used. High readings reflect excessive shorting and are viewed as bullish. Low readings signify low levels of shorting and are considered bearish. (See Short Interest Ratio.) Trailing Reversal Trading System 693 Total Win Trade %, the Trader’s Advantage The Trader’s Advantage is the Total Winning Trade Percentage, or ‘Total Win Trade %’ in our tables. This is the number of profitable trades divided by the total number of trades. This statistic is generally accorded far more attention than it deserves. Many good trend-following indicators that work well in terms of outperforming Re- ward/Risk benchmarks, because they cut losses and let profits run, actually have rel- atively low Total Winning Trade Percentages. In contrast, some indicators that work poorly in terms of underperforming Reward/Risk benchmarks actually have relatively high Total Winning Trade Percentages. In practical terms, Total Win Trade % is unim- portant relative to Reward/Risk considerations, which deserve most of our attention. Trap: Bull Trap, Bear Trap A Trap occurs when price breaks out above a resistance level or below a support level but then immediately reverses with a forceful move in the opposite direction. This traps or hooks trend-followers who went with the breakout. These trend-followers must now cut losses, which adds fuel to the new directional momentum. The result- ing fast move is of interest to short-term traders. A Bull Trap is an upside breakout followed by a fast and violent reversal to the downside. A Bear Trap is a downside breakout followed by a fast and violent reversal to the upside. Traps are quite com- mon and significant in short-term trading but are of little importance to long-term in- vesting. A Trap is also known as a Springboard. Trailing Reversal Trading System The Trailing Reversal Trading System enters a long trade when the stock price rises n percent from a recent Pivot Point Low. The system sells long and sells short when the stock price falls n percent from a recent Pivot Point High. The only variable, n percent, depends on preferred time frame and trading frequency. Typically this per- centage may vary from 1% to 5% for traders up to 7% to 15% for investors. (See Swing Filter, on page 680.) 694 Technical Market Indicators Trend Channel The Trend Channel is composed of two parallel lines moving forward in time. These two parallel lines contain most or all price fluctuations. The Trend Channel may slope upward or downward. A sideways trading range is a horizontal Trend Channel, also known as a Price Channel. Once we have established a Trendline through at least two of the more recent price pivot extremes, we may draw a parallel line through intervening extreme prices in the opposite direction. This Channel Line can be used for setting price objectives for trading within the trend. Both the basic trendline and the parallel Trend Channel offer reasonable estimates of the limits of future price swings moving forward in time. All good things must eventually come to an end. When the price moves outside the boundaries of the Channel, that signals new and more forceful price momentum. It could mean either trend acceleration (if price breaks out in the direction of the pre- vailing trend) or trend reversal (if price breaks out in the opposite direction to the pre- vailing trend). In either case, we assume that the balance of demand and supply is shifting for the financial instrument analyzed. The new price objective would be the width of the recent Channel plus or minus the breakout point. Following a period when prices have been contained within a Channel, when the price moves toward one boundary but fails to reach it by a substantial margin, that may signal a change in momentum and a shift in the balance of demand and supply. The technical analyst goes on alert for a trend change, which would be confirmed by an actual break of the Trend Channel. Trendlines, Trend Lines Trendlines are a basic tool of technical analysis. They are simple to define and to draw on any price chart, bar, candlestick, and point-and-figure. For an uptrend line, once the price has established a higher high and higher low, we can connect the lowest low with a more recent higher low. Alternately, we could judge that a better fit to the price trend could be accomplished by using the second and third higher lows for our trendline. In either case, we start with an obvious past price low that stands out on the chart, then we move our hand to the right (moving forward in time) and up (moving higher in price) to another obvious price low that was higher than the first low and happened at a later date. We connect these two points with a straight line. This is a tentative up trendline. When the price falls again and stops on that line, then the up trendline is confirmed as valid. It takes at least three points on a line to form a valid trendline. Similarly for an downtrend line, after the price has already established a lower high and lower low, we start with an obvious past price high that stands out on the Triple Exponential Moving Averages (TEMA) 697 possible combinations of period lengths. (See Three Moving Average Crossover, on page 686.) Triple Exponential Moving Averages (TEMA) Triple Exponential Moving Averages (TEMA) uses three different Exponential Mov- ing Averages (EMAs) in an effort to speed up signals and achieve a faster response to price fluctuations. TEMA was introduced by Patrick G. Mulloy in 1994, ‘ Smoothing Data With Less Lag’, Technical Analysis of Stocks & Commodities magazine, V. 12:2 (www.traders.com). TEMA uses single, double and triple EMAs. The first EMA smoothes the closing price, while the second EMA smoothes the first EMA and the third EMA smoothes the second EMA. Then, TEMA1 3EMA1 3EMA2 EMA3. Thus, TEMA1 is a composite of single, double and triple Exponential Moving Averages. In our independent observations, at short lengths, TEMA does appear to respond more effectively to changing new data than both an ordinary EMA and a Double EMA. At longer period lengths, however, TEMA responds much less effectively than the equivalent length EMA. As the table shows, TEMA underperformed a single EMA at lengths of 29 days and higher. Therefore, TEMA should not be assumed to be a substitute for any other moving average. Rather, it may best be considered to be an unfamiliar new tool to be approached with appropriately cautious respect. TEMA def- initely cannot be used in place of traditional moving averages without testing. 698 Technical Market Indicators The facing table shows a comparison of the signal performance of a standard moving average crossover rule using TEMA and an ordinary EMA of the same length, in days, as measured against the S&P 500 Composite Stock Price Index fu- tures CSI Perpetual Contract from 4/21/82 to 12/29/00. The data reflects long trades only. It is apparent that TEMA would have been a more efficient signal generator than an ordinary EMA at very short time period lengths but much less effective at longer time period lengths of more than 28 days. Indicator Strategy Example for TEMA Based on a 18-year file of daily data for the entire history of the S&P 500 Composite Stock Price Index futures CSI Perpetual Contract (www.csidata.com) from 4/21/82 to 12/29/00, we found that the following parameters would have produced a positive result on a purely mechanical signal basis with no subjectivity, no sophisticated tech- nical analysis, and no judgement: Enter Long (Buy) at the current daily price close of the S&P 500 Com- posite Stock Price Index futures CSI Perpetual Contract when that price close is greater than the 6-day TEMA, signifying a short-term price up- trend. Close Long (Sell) at the current daily price close of the S&P 500 Com- posite Stock Price Index futures CSI Perpetual Contract when that price close is less than the 6-day TEMA, signifying a short-term price down- trend. Enter Short (Sell Short) never. Starting with $100 and reinvesting profits, total net profits for this TEMA trend- following strategy would have been $815.33, assuming a fully invested strategy, rein- vestment of profits, no transactions costs and no taxes. This would have been 21.19 percent less than buy-and-hold. No short selling would have been profitable, and no short selling was included in the strategy. This long-only TEMA would have given profitable buy signals 46.97% of the time. Trading would have been very active at one trade every 7.67 calendar days.

It combines one shorter (fast) and one longer (slow) moving average to generate buy and sell signals. Buy when the fast moving average crosses above the slow moving average. Sell when the fast mov- ing average crosses below the slow moving average. The period lengths of each mov- ing average could be allowed to vary in any way, producing a number of possibilities. One possible MetaStock® System Test could be expressed as follows: Enter long: Mov(CLOSE,opt1,E) > Mov(CLOSE,opt1*opt2,E) Close long: Mov(CLOSE,opt1,E) < Mov(CLOSE,opt1*opt2,E) Enter short: Mov(CLOSE,opt1,E) < Mov(CLOSE,opt1*opt2,E) Close short: Mov(CLOSE,opt1,E) > Mov(CLOSE,opt1*opt2,E) Turtle Soup Master trader Richard Dennis trained a group of raw recruits he named Turtles. One of their strategies reportedly was to trade in the direction of a breakout from a Price Channel, specifically, buy when price makes a new 20-day high and sell short when price makes a new 20-day low. The recipe for Turtle Soup is to fade the Turtles when price reverses immediately after such a breakout and, hopefully, collect fast profits when the trend followers cut losses. (See Trap.) Place a protective stop just beyond the entry bar extreme, and trail the stop if price moves in the right direction. (See Connors, Laurence A., and Raschke, Linda Bradford, Street Smarts, High Probability Short-Term Trading Strategies, M. Gordon Publishing Group, Malibu, California, 1995, 239 pages.) Typical Price The Typical Price is calculated by adding the high, low, and closing prices together, and then dividing by three. The result is thought to be a rough estimate of the average or typical price for the period. The Typical Price may be used with many indicators in the place of the closing price. But in our testing, the closing price produces better results. Ultimate Oscillators 715 Ultimate Oscillator The Ultimate Oscillator is a time-weighted price momentum oscillator introduced by Larry Williams, ‘The Ultimate Oscillator’, Technical Analysis of Stocks & Com- modities magazine, V. 3:4, (www.traders.com). The Ultimate Oscillator uses time- weighted sums of three different oscillators, each of which is a sum of price change ratios over three different time periods, the First Cycle (short-term), the Second Cy- cle (intermediate-term) and the Third Cycle (long-term). First, calculate buying pres- sure each day, defined as the current closing price minus the lower of the current low or the previous period’s low. Sum this buying pressure over three separate time peri- ods: First Cycle, Williams suggests 7 days; Second Cycle, twice the first cycle or 14 days; and the Third Cycle twice the second cycle or 28 days. (Of course, any other time intervals, measured in days, minutes, weeks or months, could be adapted to the basic concept.) Next, these buying pressure sums are divided by similar sums using True Range. (These ratios may be thought of as the sums of buying pressure divided by the sums of buying pressure plus selling pressure.) Finally, those three ratios (buy- ing pressure/total pressure over three different time frames) are weighted by 4 for the First Cycle, 2 for the Second Cycle and 1 for the Third Cycle. Once calculated, the Ultimate Oscillator may be interpreted in six steps each for longs and shorts, according to Williams. • For long positions: 1. The oscillator must have established an oversold reading below 30. 2. There must be a bullish divergence setup, where the security’s price makes a lower low that is not confirmed by a lower low in the oscillator. 3. 4. The oscillator must break its downtrend line. When the oscillator establishes a pattern of higher highs from an oversold extreme low point below 30, there is confirmation of a new oscillator up- trend, new positive momentum, and a bullish change in the probable trend of the security’s price. 5. Take long-side profits when the oscillator moves to an extremely over- bought level above 70. 6. Close longs when the oscillator rises above 50 then falls below 45. • For short positions: 1. The oscillator must have established at least a mildly overbought reading above 50. 2. There must be a bearish divergence setup, where the security’s price makes a higher high that is not confirmed by a higher high in the oscillator. 3. The oscillator must break its uptrend line. 716 Technical Market Indicators 4. When the oscillator establishes a pattern of lower lows from an over- bought extreme high point, there is confirmation of a new oscillator downtrend, new negative momentum, and a bearish change in the proba- ble trend of the security’s price. 5. Take short side profits when the oscillator moves to an extremely oversold level below 30. 6. Close shorts when the oscillator rises above 65. Indicator Strategy Example for the Ultimate Oscillator There are many alternate ways to interpret the Ultimate Oscillator. (See Oscillators.) If we allow each of Williams’ parameters to vary, there would be a staggering num- ber of possibilities. One way to start might be to test the overbought/oversold para- meters against observed data. Based on a 18-year file of daily data for the entire history of the S&P 500 Com- posite Stock Price Index futures CSI Perpetual Contract (www.csidata.com) from 4/21/82 to 12/29/00, we found that the following parameters would have produced a positive result on a purely mechanical signal basis with no subjectivity, no sophisti- cated technical analysis, and no judgement: Enter Long (Buy) at the current daily price close of the S&P 500 Com- posite Stock Price Index futures CSI Perpetual Contract when the Ulti- mate Oscillator is below 43. Close Long (Sell) at the current daily price close of the S&P 500 Com- posite Stock Price Index futures CSI Perpetual Contract when the Ulti- mate Oscillator is above 73. Enter Short (Sell Short) at the current daily price close of the S&P 500 Composite Stock Price Index futures CSI Perpetual Contract when the Ul- timate Oscillator is above 74. Close Short (Cover) at the current daily price close of the S&P 500 Com- posite Stock Price Index futures CSI Perpetual Contract when the Ulti- mate Oscillator is below 49. Starting with $100 and reinvesting profits, total net profits for this Ultimate Oscillator strategy would have been $1,357.21, assuming a fully invested strategy, reinvestment of profits, no transactions costs and no taxes. This would have been 31.20 percent greater than buy-and-hold. Even short selling would have been slightly profitable, and short selling was included in the strategy. This long and short Ultimate Oscillator strategy would have given profitable buy signals 96.00% of the time and profitable sell short signals 57.14% of the time. Note that this contra-trend strategy Ultimate Oscillators 717 does not include a stop loss, and there are occasional large equity drawdowns. Trad- ing would have been relatively inactive at one trade every 148.43 calendar days.

Most commonly, daily or weekly NYSE data is used in the calculation, and similar indicators could be applied to data from other exchanges. The popular assumption behind the indicator is that stock prices tend to bottom out when the great majority of stocks are participating in a market decline. Therefore, the Unchanged Issues Index is low. Conversely, the popular interpretation is that the market tops out when the majority of stocks stall out due to full valuation, and the Unchanged Issues Index is high. The popular interpretation does not hold up under objective testing, however. On the contrary, the data suggests that relatively high readings on the Unchanged Is- sues Index are bearish, while low readings are bullish. But the results are not strong. Indicator Strategy Example of the Unchanged Issues Index Based on a 68-year file of daily data for the Unchanged Issues Index (the total num- ber of shares unchanged divided by the total number of shares traded each day on the NYSE) and the DJIA since 1932, we found that extreme moves below and above Bollinger Bands placed at two standard deviations around the previous day’s 7-day exponential moving average (See Bollinger Bands) would have produced a mildly positive result on a purely mechanical signal basis with no subjectivity, no sophisti- cated technical analysis, and no judgement: Enter Long (Buy) at the current daily price close of the DJIA when the Unchanged Issues Index falls below the previous day’s lower Bollinger Band placed at two standard deviations below a 7-day exponential moving average (EMA) of the Unchanged Issues Index. Close Long (Sell) at the current daily price close of the DJIA when the Unchanged Issues Index rises above the previous day’s upper Bollinger Band placed at two standard deviations above a 7-day EMA of the Un- changed Issues Index. Sell Long and Sell Short at the current daily price close of the DJIA when the Unchanged Issues Index rises above the previous day’s upper Bollinger Band placed at two standard deviations above a 7-day EMA of the Unchanged Issues Index. Cover Short and Buy Long at the current daily price close of the DJIA when the Unchanged Issues Index falls below the previous day’s lower Unchanged Issues Index 721 Bollinger Band placed at two standard deviations below a 7-day EMA of the Unchanged Issues Index. Starting with $100 and reinvesting profits, total net profits for the Unchanged Issues Index would have been $9,403.33, assuming a fully invested strategy, reinvestment of profits, no transactions costs and no taxes. This would have been 25.01 percent below buy-and-hold. Short selling would have been unprofitable and most of the short trades would have lost money. A long only strategy (not shown) beat buy-and-hold, and 59.38% of the long trades were winners. The Equis International MetaStock® System Testing rules, where the Un- changed Issues Index is inserted into the data field normally reserved for Volume (V), are written as follows: Enter long: V<Ref(BBandBot(V,opt1,E,opt2),-1) Close long: V>Ref(BBandTop(V,opt1,E,opt2),-1) Enter short: V>Ref(BBandTop(V,opt1,E,opt2),-1) Close short: V<Ref(BBandBot(V,opt1,E,opt2),-1) OPT1 Current value: 7 OPT2 Current value: 2 724 Technical Market Indicators Upside/Downside Ratio The Upside/Downside Ratio is the volume of advancing issues divided by the volume of declining issues. Daily NYSE data normally is used in the calculation. The Upside/Downside Ratio was designed to measure buying and selling pres- sure. High readings indicate buying pressure, which is bullish. Low readings reflect selling pressure, which is bearish. Martin Zweig (900 Third Avenue, New York, NY 10022, (212) 755-9860) found that a daily Upside/Downside Ratio of greater than 9 to 1 has been extremely bullish. Every bull market, and many strong intermediate up moves, have begun with a greater than 9 to 1 reading of the Upside/Downside Ratio. Furthermore, in cases where two readings greater than 9 to 1 occurred within 3 months or less, average gains in stock prices were significant. From January 1960 to May 1985, 12 buy signals were given, by 2 days within a 3-month period having readings of greater than 9 to 1. In every case Zweig found that stock prices were higher 6 and 12 months later. The average gains after 6 and 12 months were 14% and 20.7%, respectively. Updating Zweig’s study since May 1985, there have been only four signals where two readings greater than 9 to 1 occurred within 3 months. On balance, the four signals that did occur were profitable, as measured from the second 9 to 1 signal date. The results are shown in the table below. There have not been two signals within 3 months since September 6, 1988.

Close Long (Sell) at the current daily price close of the S&P 500 when the Upside/Downside Ratio crosses below its own previous day’s trailing 3-day EMA. Enter Short (Sell Short) at the current daily price close of the S&P 500 when the Upside/Downside Ratio crosses below its own previous day’s trailing 3-day EMA. Close Short (Cover) at the current daily price close of the S&P 500 when the Upside/Downside Ratio crosses above its own previous day’s trailing 3-day EMA. Starting with $100 and reinvesting profits, total net profits for this Upside/Downside Ratio trend-following strategy would have been $1,157.23, assum- ing a fully invested strategy, reinvestment of profits, no transactions costs and no taxes. This would have been 26.91 percent better than buy-and-hold. Even short sell- ing would have been profitable. Trading would have been hyperactive with one trade every 2.80 calendar days. The Equis International MetaStock® System Testing rules, where the current Upside/Downside Ratio times 10,000 is inserted into the data field normally reserved for Volume (V), are written as follows: Enter long: V > Ref(Mov(V,opt1,E),-1) Close long: V < Ref(Mov(V,opt1,E),-1) Enter short: V < Ref(Mov(V,opt1,E),-1) Close short: V > Ref(Mov(V,opt1,E),-1) OPT1 Current value: 3 728 Technical Market Indicators Volatility, Introduction Volatility is a measure of up and down price movement, without regard to trend di- rection. All measures of plain volatility are based on past price fluctuation, but what we really need to know is future volatility. There is no way to know what that will be, however. It seems to depend on investors’ emotions. Plain volatility without trend di- rection is generally misleading. There are many ways to compute volatility. Many use Greek symbols and are quite complex and difficult to understand. All methods attempt to quantify how much price fluctuation there has been. Volatility is often defined as a measure of a stock’s tendency to move up and down in price, based on its daily price history over, say, the latest month or year or other period. As an example of perhaps the simplest possible approach to a difficult problem, volatility might be defined as the percentage price change or fluctuation over a given period of time. (Note that you would need to use percentage price changes rather than dollar or point price changes to allow proper comparisons over time because of dramatically changing price levels in the long bull market.) We have experimented with many formulations of volatility and found that volatility is a coincident indicator that can change frequently, rapidly and unpre- dictably, or hardly at all, depending on the mood of the trading crowd. Price fluctua- tion alone, without consideration for price trend, appears to contain little useful information. And this is the weakness of strategies that depend on historical volatil- ity, such as many past options and derivatives valuation attempts. The use of complex measures of variance based on past volatility to construct portfolios and to value derivatives does not appear to have allowed users to outper- form the benchmark S&P 500 Index buy-and-hold strategy. On the contrary, the com- plex mathematics of finance failed spectacularly at least twice in the past: Portfolio Insurance caused, or at least worsened, the Crash of 1987; and in August 1998 Long- Term Capital Management’s failed derivatives strategies brought the entire U.S. fi- nancial system to the brink of disaster, which was only narrowly averted by timely intervention by Federal Reserve Board officials. Mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot conjectured that stock price change distribu- tions have infinite variance. Bill Eckhardt (Schwager, Jack D., The New Market Wiz- ards, Harper Collins, New York, 1992, 493 pages) pointed out that if this variance is not finite, then sometime in the unforeseeable future there could be more extreme sce- narios than we might be able to imagine. Even the 1-day, 20% S&P 500 Index price drop on October 19, 1987, might not be as extreme as it possibly could become. Also, if market prices do not have a finite variance, then any classically derived estimate of risk for the buy-and-hold strategy could be significantly understated. In sum, historical measures of volatility, without consideration for trend direc- tion, cannot be counted on. Volatility measurements taken over the past 30-days or a Volatility, CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) 729 year, however popular, may prove badly misleading at the most critical times when we need good analysis the most. Volatility, Chaikin’s Chaikin’s Volatility, developed by veteran technical analyst Marc Chaikin, measures the smoothed velocity of the spread between a security’s high and low prices. First, Chaikin subtracts the daily low from the high. Next, he calculates a 10-day exponen- tial moving average of those daily differences. Finally, he computes a 10-day per- centage rate-of-change of that exponential moving average. Using 62-years of daily high-low data from 1928, we found that a marginal profit would have been made if we bought the DJIA when Chaikin’s Volatility crossed below zero, indicating falling volatility, and we sold and sold short when it crossed above zero, indicating rising volatility. This strategy would have lost money since the Crash of ’87, solely due to persistent losses on the short side in the record breaking bull market. A long-only strategy would have been profitable, but even that under performed buy-and-hold. The opposite strategy, buying rising volatility and selling falling volatility, would have lost heavily. Like other volatility indicators we have tested, Chaikin’s Volatility does not appear particularly fruitful as a stand-alone indicator. The MetaStock® indicator-builder formula for Chaikin’s Volatility may be ex- pressed as follows: ROC(Mov(H-L,10,E),10,%); Input(‘Plot a horizontal line at’,-100,100,0); Volatility, CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) The CBOE’s Volatility Index (VIX) is a relatively new volatility indicator that has gained popularity with some traders because it offers up-to-the-minute estimates of the stock market’s implied volatility using real-time stock option bid/ask quotes. VIX is a weighted average of the implied volatilities of eight OEX calls and puts with an average time to maturity of 30 days. Implied volatility is the volatility percentage that explains the current market price of an option. Implied volatility reflects option spec- ulators’ emotions of greed and fear. VIX shoots upward when options traders fear the market might collapse. Then VIX reverts to the mean when the selling panic is over and traders calm down. The 14.75-year average level of VIX is about 20. VIX jumped to a record 152.48 during the day on so-called Black Monday 10/19/87, the Crash of ’87. It took 4 months for 732 Technical Market Indicators VIX to return to the 20s. As price ranges narrowed from 1991 to 1996, VIX spent most of its time in a below-average 11 to 19 range, as the chart on page 730 shows. VIX set its record low at 8.86 on 12/23/93. Indicator Strategy Example for Volatility (VIX) Historical data shows that Volatility (VIX) is bullish when in a rising trend. On the long side, the trend of VIX would have been profitable, though not as profitable as the buy-and-hold strategy, and right more often than wrong. On the short side, however, the trend of VIX would have been unprofitable across all daily time horizons and wrong more often than right. Based on the VIX as posted on the CBOE web site and a 14.75-year file of daily data for the S&P 500 Composite Stock Price Index futures CSI Perpetual Contract from January 1986 to September 2000 collected from www.csidata.com, we found that the following parameters would have produced the following result on a purely mechanical trend-following signal basis with no subjectivity, no sophisticated techni- cal analysis, and no judgement: Enter Long (Buy) at the current daily price close of the S&P 500 Com- posite Stock Price Index futures CSI Perpetual Contract when VIX today is greater than yesterday’s 10-day EMA of VIX, indicting a rising trend of Volatility. Close Long (Sell) at the current daily price close of the S&P 500 Com- posite Stock Price Index futures CSI Perpetual Contract when VIX today is less than yesterday’s 10-day EMA of VIX, indicting a falling trend of Volatility. Sell Short never. Starting with $100 and reinvesting profits, total net profits for this VIX strategy would have been $ 322.27, assuming a fully invested strategy, reinvestment of prof- its, no transactions costs, and no taxes. This would have been 46.65% less than buy- and-hold. Short selling would have lost heavily and consistently and was not included. Trading would have been active, with one trade every 12.42 calendar days. This indicator would have been right more often than wrong for long trades, with 63.43% winning long-side trades. Volatility Bands 733 The Equis International MetaStock® System Testing rules, where VIX is in- serted into the data field normally reserved for volume, are written as follows: Enter long: V > Ref(Mov(V,opt1,E),-1) Close long: V < Ref(Mov(V,opt1,E),-1) Enter short: V < Ref(Mov(V,opt1,E),-1) Close short: V > Ref(Mov(V,opt1,E),-1) OPT1 Current value: 10 Volatility Bands Volatility bands around a moving average are a better approach to analyzing volatil- ity. They can be usefully quantified and made to work in a trading system. (See Bollinger Bands.) Bollinger Bands may be applied to Volatility (VIX) itself. The following para- meters produced signals that were right more often than wrong but still did not keep pace with a passive buy-and-hold strategy. The Equis International MetaStock® Sys- tem Testing rules, where VIX is inserted into the data field normally reserved for vol- ume, are written as follows: Enter long: Mov(V,opt3,E) > Ref(BBandTop(V,opt1,E,opt2),-1) Close long: Mov(V,opt3,E) < Ref(BBandTop(V,opt1,E,opt2),-1) Enter short: Mov(V,opt3,E) < Ref(BBandBot(V,opt1,E,opt2),-1) Close short: Mov(V,opt3,E) > Ref(BBandBot(V,opt1,E,opt2),-1) OPT1 Current value: 13 OPT2 Current value: 2 OPT3 Current value: 1 734 Technical Market Indicators Volatility & Price Channel Volatility & Price Channel is a combined indicator system, of which there are billions and billions. Here, when the price both breaks out of a trading range and price volatil- ity increases on the breakout, a signal to buy or sell is recognized. Volatility can be described various ways, including Average True Range, which is an average of recent high minus low price ranges over some variable look-back period, such as 6 days. An increase in volatility indicates greater price movement, which implies greater inten- sity of buying or selling. This greater movement and intensity make the price action more significant than a price breakout alone without increasing volatility. Therefore, a price channel breakout with rising volatility triggers a signal to buy or sell in order to follow the direction of the breakout. Indicator Strategy Example for a Volatility & Price Channel Trend-Following Strategy Based on daily data for the S&P 500 Stock Index Futures CSI Perpetual Contract from 4/21/82 to 5/23/01 collected from www.csidata.com, we found that the follow- ing specific parameters would have produced a positive result on a purely mechani- cal trend-following signal basis with no subjectivity, no sophisticated technical analysis, and no judgement: Enter Long (Buy) at the current daily price close of the S&P 500 Stock Index Futures CSI Perpetual Contract when the daily price close is greater than the previous day’s close and the current daily high-low range is greater than 138% of the previous day’s Average True Range with a look- back period of 6 days. Close Long (Sell) at the current daily price close of the S&P 500 Stock In- dex Futures CSI Perpetual Contract when the daily price close is less than the lowest daily close over the trailing 84 trading days and the current daily high-low range is greater than 138% of the previous day’s Average True Range with a look-back period of 6 days. Enter Short (Sell Short) at the current daily price close of the S&P 500 Stock Index Futures CSI Perpetual Contract when the daily price close is less than the lowest daily close over the trailing 84 trading days and the current daily high-low range is greater than 138% of the previous day’s Average True Range with a look-back period of 6 days. Close Short (Cover) at the current daily price close of the S&P 500 Stock Index Futures CSI Perpetual Contract when the daily price close is greater than the previous day’s close and the current daily high-low range is Volatility & Price Channel 735 greater than 138% of the previous day’s Average True Range with a look- back period of 6 days. Starting with $100 and reinvesting profits, total net profits for this Volatility & Price Channel Trend-Following Strategy would have been would have been $2,089.03, assuming a fully invested strategy, reinvestment of profits, no transactions costs, and no taxes. This would have been 109.29 percent greater than buy-and-hold. Short selling would have been only slightly unprofitable, and short selling was in- cluded in the strategy. This contrary indicator would have given profitable buy signals 62.50% of the time. Trading would have been relatively inactive at one trade every 217.91 calendar days. The chart shows how Cumulative Equity for this Volatility & Price Channel Trend-Following Strategy, which started lower (at 100) then crossed above the un- managed S&P 500 Stock Index Futures CSI Perpetual Contract in the Crash of Oc- tober ’87 as the Volatility & Price Channel strategy profited while buy-and-hold lost heavily. Also, note milder equity drawdowns in general for the Volatility & Price Channel versus the unmanaged contract. Greater profitability with milder drawdowns are desirable qualities in an indicator.

Outliers are unusual, aberrant data points that stray far from the mean. Outliers can offer trading opportunities. Several known trading systems at- tempt to take advantage of data outliers. Statistics are commonly used to measure the variability of data around its cen- tral tendency, quantifying how far from the mean the observations stray and how much variability is normal and abnormal. Variability (the spread of the data) can be measured by the range, variance, and standard deviation. Range is simply the high minus the low in the data sample and it includes all outliers, which might give one a distorted impression of the typical variability. Variance measures the average variability around the mean by summing the squared deviations of each data point from the mean, then dividing that sum by the number of observations minus one, as expressed in the following formula: s2 ( ((x x¯)2)) (SUMMATION ((x Mean)2)) / (n 1) n 1 Standard Deviation is the square root of the Variance. This may appear to be more useful than Variance because, by taking the square root of the average squared differences between observed data points and their mean, we thereby convert the measure of variability back into the same units of measure as the raw data we started with. In the case of stocks, for example, the unit of measure would be dollars per share. The smaller the standard deviation, the more tightly the measurements in a sam- ple cluster around the mean. A smaller standard deviation implies greater consistency. A normal distribution, which is shaped like a symmetrical bell curve, contains approximately 67% of all the observed data within plus or minus one standard devia- tion around the mean. Approximately 95% of the data is within plus or minus two standard deviations around the mean. And approximately 99.7% of the data is within plus or minus three standard deviations around the mean. Unfortunately, market data is not necessarily normally distributed. Rather, the distribution curve is often skewed to one side because of overbalance of data outliers in one direction. For example, in a sharply rising bull market, the distribution curve might be positively skewed, with a long tail to the right. In a prolonged and severe bear market, however, there might be a negative skew, with a long tail to the left. The problem is that any statistics we may calculate are entirely dependent on past data rather than reflecting the unknown future data that we can only wish we had. That deficiency may not entirely preclude detection of some useful tendencies, other Volatility Ratios 739 things being equal. Still, experience in sudden market jolts, such as the Crash of Oc- tober 1987, suggests that reliance on past tendencies may be costly when investor emotions are running wild. Mechanical and statistical tools need to be filtered with sound technical analysis. For a further discussion of the statistical approach to volatility expansions, see: Kase, Cynthia A., Trading with the Odds: Using the Power of Probability to Profit in the Futures Market, Irwin Professional Publishing, 1996, 149 pages. Volatility Index, Art Merrill’s Version Arthur A. Merrill, CMT, has devised a simple measure of volatility for the DJIA by simply calculating the absolute value of the daily percentage price changes. He aver- ages these daily changes for each full week (which is usually five trading days, except when there is a holiday). Then he smoothes this average weekly volatility with a 5-week EMA. Merrill calculates plus and minus 67% of one standard deviation of the smoothed volatility. These should contain the middle quartiles, approximately. He in- terprets the 5-week exponentially smoothed volatility relative to its upper and lower 67% of one standard deviation bands as follows: a ratio above 67% of one standard deviation is bullish; a ratio below 67% of one standard deviation is bearish. Using a chi-squared test of significance and a test period covering 1971 to 1982, Merrill found that this indicator correctly predicted the direction of the general mar- ket as measured by the DJIA 63% of the time over the next 13 weeks. This result was highly significant statistically. It predicted the market 60% of the time over the next 26 weeks, which was significant. It accurately predicted 57% of the time over the next 5 weeks, which was probably significant. Accuracy over the next one and 52 weeks was only a little better than 50%, which was insignificant statistically. Volatility Ratios Pure volatility measures that fail to distinguish upside price movement from down- side price movement are of questionable value for market timing. In the first edition of this encyclopedia, we tested weekly High/Low price ratios applied to the New York Stock Composite Index as a simple measure of volatility. We were not able to find any objective decision rule that offered consistent profitability. The distribution of profits over various time lengths assumed erratic patterns. There were losses in many time intervals. We concluded that using volatility as a market timing indicator did not appear to be fruitful. 740 Technical Market Indicators For this second edition, we tested the absolute value of daily closing price per- centage changes for the DJIA from 1900 to 2001 using our standard Exponential Moving Average Crossover model. Again, we were not able to find a timing rule that beat buy-and-hold. We wrote our Equis International MetaStock® System Testing rules as follows: Enter long: Abs(ROC(C,opt1,%)) > Ref(Mov(Abs(ROC(C,opt1,%)),opt2,E),-1) Close long: Abs(ROC(C,opt1,%)) < Ref(Mov(Abs(ROC(C,opt1,%)),opt2,E),-1) Enter short: Abs(ROC(C,opt1,%)) < Ref(Mov(Abs(ROC(C,opt1,%)),opt2,E),-1) Close short: Abs(ROC(C,opt1,%)) > Ref(Mov(Abs(ROC(C,opt1,%)),opt2,E),-1) OPT1 Current value: 1 OPT2 Current value: 6 742 Technical Market Indicators We also tried an acceleration model, but we found even worse results. We wrote our Equis International MetaStock® System Testing rules as follows: Enter long: (Mov((Abs(ROC(C,1,%))),opt1,E)/ Ref(Mov((Abs(ROC(C,1,%))),opt2*opt1,E),-1))/ (Ref(Mov((Mov((Abs(ROC(C,1,%))),opt1,E)/ Ref(Mov((Abs(ROC(C,1,%))),opt2*opt1,E),-1)),opt1,E),-1))> 1 Close long: (Mov((Abs(ROC(C,1,%))),opt1,E)/ Ref(Mov((Abs(ROC(C,1,%))),opt2*opt1,E),-1))/ (Ref(Mov((Mov((Abs(ROC(C,1,%))),opt1,E)/ Ref(Mov((Abs(ROC(C,1,%))),opt2*opt1,E),-1)),opt1,E),-1))<1 Enter short: (Mov((Abs(ROC(C,1,%))),opt1,E)/ Ref(Mov((Abs(ROC(C,1,%))),opt2*opt1,E),-1))/ (Ref(Mov((Mov((Abs(ROC(C,1,%))),opt1,E)/ Ref(Mov((Abs(ROC(C,1,%))),opt2*opt1,E),-1)),opt1,E),-1))<1 Close short: (Mov((Abs(ROC(C,1,%))),opt1,E)/ Ref(Mov((Abs(ROC(C,1,%))),opt2*opt1,E),-1))/ (Ref(Mov((Mov((Abs(ROC(C,1,%))),opt1,E)/ Ref(Mov((Abs(ROC(C,1,%))),opt2*opt1,E),-1)),opt1,E),-1))> 1 OPT1 Range: From 1 to 12 by 1, Current value: 2 OPT2 Range: From 1 to 12 by 1, Current value: 4 Finally, we switched to weekly price changes and again applied velocity, accel- eration, and deceleration models. Results were discouraging for all approaches. Volume 743 Volume Volume is a key technical indicator serving an important analytical function. The vol- ume of stock transactions, also known as turnover and trading activity, is the number of shares changing hands in a given period (hour, day, week, month, year, and so forth). High and rising volume confirms the price trend in a bull market. Volume usu- ally peaks before the final price top. Also, volume confirms breakouts: when price moves out of a sideways trading range, through a sloping Trend Channel, or through any support or resistance level, volume should increase to confirm the validity of the breakout. When a stock breaks out upward, a pickup in volume indicates fresh buying in- terest, new demand, new buyers entering the market. When a stock breaks out downward, a pickup in volume indicates fresh selling, new supply, new sellers entering the market. A breakout lacking volume confirmation is not to be entirely trusted. Low vol- ume indicates apathy, indecision, and lack of attraction to a stock on both sides, the buy side and the sell side. Then, price is more likely to drift aimlessly reflecting lack of investor interest in the stock. A breakout on low volume is more likely to be an aberration. Occasionally, high volume can also signal a temporary excess, an overbought or oversold extreme. Extremely active trading is sometimes associated with minor price turning points, as in a buying or selling climax, when the irrational exuberance of the crowd reaches an unsustainable extreme. These junctures can be followed by price temporary corrections in the opposite direction to the prevailing trend. Generally, however, a major trend is not reversed by just one high-volume climax. Rather, it takes time and further testing to turn the Primary Tide. A great old Wall Street saying is, ‘Volume is a weapon of the Bull—it takes fresh buying to push prices higher, but prices can fall of their own weight.’ True, it does take relatively strong demand from buyers versus supply from sellers to push prices higher. Prices move up when demand (buying) overbalances supply (supply). Also, in general, high volume is bullish more often than not. Since for every share that is sold a share is bought, high volume at least indicates that significant buying de- mand is present. On the other hand, prices can fall a long distance on light volume. For example, well into a bear market, after investors realize that stock prices are in persistent down- trend, few want to buy stocks, so volume dries up. Prices can drift a long way down as sellers look for bids but do not find enough bids to absorb all their stock offerings. So, volume can remain relatively low while prices move lower and lower as sellers search for buyers willing to take the stock, to take the other side of the trade. When 744 Technical Market Indicators there are no bids nearby, the price may fall in a vacuum, dropping straight down with no volume at all, making a price gap on the chart. There is no perfect indicator, and volume is subject to distortions that can boost or depress the total number of shares changing hands for reasons other than demand and supply. These distortions include holidays, seasonal patterns, buy and sell pro- grams, arbitrage, dynamic hedging, block trades, and index fund position adjust- ments. When these distortions become significant, indicators weighted by volume suffer some instability. Another great old Wall Street saying is, ‘In price there is knowledge.’ True, price most reliably and consistently reflects the demand and supply balance for stocks. Nevertheless, volume is a very useful confirming indicator that has proved it- self over many decades of actual practice. Volume adds value to a complete technical analysis. Indicator Strategy Example for Pure Volume Only There are many indicators that incorporate volume, and they are covered in these pages. The best volume indicators combine volume with price. At the purest and most basic level, historical data shows that high volume is bullish and low volume is bear- ish. Based on the trend of the number of shares traded each day on the NYSE for 72 years from 1928 to 2000, we found that the following parameters would have pro- duced a positive result on a purely mechanical trend-following signal basis with no subjectivity, no sophisticated technical analysis, and no judgement: Enter Long (Buy) at the current daily price close of the DJIA when the NYSE Volume today is greater than yesterday’s 220-day EMA of the daily volume. Close Long (Sell) at the current daily price close of the DJIA when the NYSE Volume today is less than yesterday’s 220-day EMA of the daily volume. Enter Short (Sell Short) at the current daily price close of the DJIA when the NYSE Volume today is less than yesterday’s 220-day EMA of the daily volume. Close Short (Cover) at the current daily price close of the DJIA when the NYSE Volume today is greater than yesterday’s 220-day exponential mov- ing average of the daily volume. Volume 745 Starting with $100 and reinvesting profits, total net profits for this Pure Volume Only strategy would have been $12,007.92, assuming a fully invested strategy, rein- vestment of profits, no transactions costs, and no taxes. This would have been 177.21% better than the passive buy-and-hold strategy. There would have been more winning trades than losing trades for long trades, but the opposite would have been true for short sales. Curiously, the Volume trend-following strategy would not have been profitable over the past 14 years, due to losses on short sales. The Equis International MetaStock® System Testing rules are written as follows: Enter long: V > Ref(Mov(V,opt1,E),-1) Close long: V < Ref(Mov(V,opt1,E),-1) Enter short: V < Ref(Mov(V,opt1,E),-1) Close short: V > Ref(Mov(V,opt1,E),-1) OPT1 Current value: 220 748 Technical Market Indicators Volume Acceleration Volume Acceleration is a two-part indicator based on the Volume * Price Momentum Oscillator (V*PMO). Volume Acceleration takes into consideration both the V*PMO position relative to zero (above or below) and whether V*PMO is rising or falling relative to its pre- vious day’s level. When the n-period exponential moving average of V*PMO is positive and ris- ing, momentum is bullish and accelerating, so we buy. We exit longs when momen- tum decelerates, thus indicating that the rally is losing steam. When the n-period exponential moving average of V*PMO is negative and falling, momentum is bearish and accelerating to the downside, so we sell short. We exit short positions when negative momentum decelerates, thus indicating that the bear is losing its destructive power. Indicator Strategy Example of Volume Acceleration Historical data shows that, Volume Acceleration is a more effective indicator than the Volume * Price Momentum Oscillator (V*PMO) alone. Based on the number of shares traded each day on the NYSE and the daily prices for the DJIA for more than 72 years from 1928 to 2001, we found that the following parameters would have pro- duced a significantly positive result on a purely mechanical trend-following signal ba- sis with no subjectivity, no sophisticated technical analysis, and no judgement: Enter Long (Buy) at the current daily price close of the DJIA when the 3-day EMA of the daily V*PMO is greater than zero and moving higher relative to its previous day’s level. Close Long (Sell) at the current daily price close of the DJIA when the 3-day EMA of the daily V*PMO is less than zero or when V*PMO moves lower relative to its previous day’s level. Enter Short (Sell Short) at the current daily price close of the DJIA when the 3-day EMA of the daily V*PMO is less than zero and moving lower relative to its previous day’s level. Close Short (Cover) at the current daily price close of the DJIA when the 3-day EMA of the daily V*PMO is greater than zero or when V*PMO moves higher relative to its previous day’s level. Starting with $100 and reinvesting profits, total net profits for this Volume Ac- celeration strategy would have been $72,812,288, assuming a fully invested strategy, reinvestment of profits, no transactions costs, and no taxes. This would have been Volume Acceleration 749 1,767,385.88% better than the passive buy-and-hold strategy. Short selling would have been profitable over the full 72 years, but unprofitable since 1987.

In their sim- plest forms, they are based on the running total of each day’s volume times the dif- ference between the daily closing price minus the midpoint of the daily price range. So, instead of measuring price change from the previous close, which is the more common practice, here we measure the day’s price change from the day’s median price, the mid point. Mathematically, the formula for the cumulative total of Volume Accumulation is expressed as follows: Cum((C-(H L)/2)*V) where Cum means cumulating a running total of the daily values of the expression that follows in parenthesis. C the closing price for a period. H the highest price for the same period. L the lowest price for the period. V the total volume of trading activity for the period. For example, if the current period’s highest price is 180, the lowest price 160, the close 165, and the volume 2000, then the day’s closing price of 165 minus the midpoint of 170 is minus 5. Then, multiply 5 times the day’s volume of 2000 to ar- rive at the day’s Volume Accumulation of 10,000: (C-(H L)/2)*V ((165-(180 160)/2)*2000 (-5)*2000 10,000 Next, compute a running total of these daily calculations for the Volume Accumula- tion Cumulative Total. We can then plot that as a line, and we can measure the trend of that cumulative total of daily values in various ways, including chart patterns, trend lines, moving averages, etc. For example, the chart at the top of the facing page shows the Volume Accumulation Cumulative Total with a large rollover top (like a Complex Head-and-Shoulders Top) in 1999 and sharp drop in 2000, offering dramatic possi- bilities in chart interpretation. Note that with Volume Accumulation so negative, its followers might have been unprofitably bearish from October 1999 until the joint S&P and NASDAQ top in March 2000. Alternately, we can convert this cumulative total into an oscillator by, for exam- ple, subtracting from it some moving average of itself. (See Oscillators.) The chart at the bottom of the facing page shows Volume Accumulation as a sensitive, short-term oscillator, computed by subtracting the current Volume Accumulation cumulative total minus its own previous day’s 2-day EMA, then dividing that difference by the 754 Technical Market Indicators previous day’s 2-day EMA, in order to normalize the scale. This Volume Accumula- tion Oscillator can be plotted with the following Equis MetaStock® Indicator Builder formula: ((Cum((C-(H L)/2)*V))- (Ref(Mov(Cum((C-(H L)/2)*V),2,E),-1)))/ (Ref(Mov(Cum((C-(H L)/2)*V),2,E),-1)); Input(‘Plot a horizontal line at’,-0.25,0.25,0); Indicator Strategy Example for the Volume Accumulation Oscillator and Trend Historical data shows that Volume Accumulation can be an effective indicator, par- ticularly on the long side. Based on the number of shares traded each day on the NYSE and the daily prices for the DJIA for 73 years from 1928 to 2001, we found that the following parameters would have produced a positive result on a purely me- chanical trend-following signal basis with no subjectivity, no sophisticated technical analysis, and no judgement: Enter Long (Buy) at the current daily price close of the DJIA when the Volume Accumulation Cumulative Line (that is, the daily running total) to- day is greater than yesterday’s 2-day EMA of the daily Volume Accumu- lation Cumulative Line. Close Long (Sell) at the current daily price close of the DJIA when the Volume Accumulation daily running total today is less than yesterday’s 2-day EMA of the daily Volume Accumulation Cumulative Line. Enter Short (Sell Short) at the current daily price close of the DJIA when the Volume Accumulation daily running total today is less than yesterday’s 2-day EMA of the daily Volume Accumulation Cumulative Line. Close Short (Cover) at the current daily price close of the DJIA when the Volume Accumulation daily running total today is greater than yesterday’s 2-day EMA of the daily Volume Accumulation Cumulative Line. Starting with $100 and reinvesting profits, total net profits for this Volume Ac- cumulation Oscillator strategy would have been $18,863,680, assuming a fully invested strategy, reinvestment of profits, no transactions costs, and no taxes. This would have been 457,807.44% better than the passive buy-and-hold strategy. Despite these impressive numbers, however, this Volume Accumulation Oscillator trend- following strategy would not have been profitable since 1987, due to losses on short sales.

To calculate it, there are only two steps: 1. Compute daily net advancing volume by subtracting the Volume of Declin- ing Issues from the Volume of Advancing Issues traded each day on the NYSE. 2. Add that daily net difference to the cumulative total of the daily net advanc- ing volume as of the preceding day. Historically, the interpretation of this indicator has been dependent on the chart reading skills of the technical analyst, who typically relies upon his judgements of trend, pattern, and divergence versus a stock price index, such as the S&P 500 or the DJIA. Indicator Strategy Example for the Cumulative Volume Index The Cumulative Volume Index can be an effective indicator viewed entirely objec- tively. Based on a 37-year file of daily data of the volume behind the number of shares advancing and declining each day on the NYSE and the DJIA, we found that the simplest possible trend-following rule would have produced a positive result on a purely mechanical signal basis with no subjectivity, no sophisticated technical analy- sis, and no judgement: Enter Long (Buy) at the current daily price close of the DJIA when the Cumulative Volume Index rises relative to its level the previous day. Close Long (Sell) at the current daily price close of the DJIA when the Cumulative Volume Index falls relative to its level the previous day. Enter Short (Sell Short) at the current daily price close of the DJIA when the Cumulative Volume Index falls relative to its level the previous day. Close Short (Cover) at the current daily price close of the DJIA when the Cumulative Volume Index rises relative to its level the previous day. Starting with $100 and reinvesting profits, total net profits for this Cumulative Volume Index trend-following strategy would have been $852,743.19, assuming a fully invested strategy, reinvestment of profits, no transactions costs, and no taxes. This would have been 66,357.02% better than buy-and-hold. Short selling would have been profitable, but not since the bottom of 8/12/82. Trading would have been hyperactive with one trade every 3.59 calendar days. (See chart on page 760.) Volume of Issues, Advancing 759 The Equis International MetaStock® System Testing rules, where the current Cumulative Volume Index is inserted into the data field normally reserved for Volume (V), are written as follows: Enter long: V > Ref(V,-1) Close long: V < Ref(V,-1) Enter short: V < Ref(V,-1) Close short: V > Ref(V,-1) Volume: Cumulative Volume Ratio The Cumulative Volume Index, more often than not, produces a line with an upward bias. This is because it does not adjust for distortions that tend to inflate volume over time, namely, the ever growing number of issues listed, numerous stock splits, and derivatives arbitrage trading. To adjust the data in order to gain comparability, we could try the following transformation of the daily data before cumulating net volume in a running total: V ( A D ) / ( A D) where V today’s 1-day Volume Index A Volume of Advancing Issues D Volume of Declining Issues Curiously, this formula produces a chart line with a downward bias that is more mis- leading than the upward bias of the more popular Cumulative Volume Index. The rea- son behind these biases is that stocks tend to rise on high volume and fall on low volume. As the old saying goes, ‘It takes volume to push stocks higher, but they fall of their own weight.’ Volume of Issues, Advancing The volume of advancing issues is the total volume of advancing stocks, those stocks that end the current day at a higher price than their previous day’s closing price. Data for the New York Stock Exchange is used most frequently, and data for the NASDAQ and American Stock Exchange is also widely available. Advancing volume offers an indication of buying pressure: it is bullish when advancing volume (or a moving 762 Technical Market Indicators average of advancing volume) rises; it is bearish when advancing volume falls. Ad- vancing volume is most often used as a component of another indicator, such as Cu- mulative Volume Index, Arms’ Short-Term Trading Index, Ninety Percent Days, and Upside/Downside Volume Ratio. Volume of Issues, Declining The volume of declining issues is the total volume of declining stocks, those stocks that end the current day at a lower price than their previous day’s closing price. De- clining volume offers an indication of selling pressure: it is bearish when declining volume (or a moving average of declining volume) rises; it is bullish when declining volume falls. Coupled with Advancing volume, Declining volume is most often used as a component of another indicator. Volume: Klinger Oscillator (KO) This volume-based oscillator was developed by Stephen J. Klinger. It is computed in seven steps: 1. Find the average price of the day by summing the high, low, and close, then dividing by three. 2. If today’s average price is greater than the previous day’s average price, as- sign a plus sign to today’s volume. 3. If today’s average price is less than the previous day’s average price, assign a minus sign to today’s volume. 4. Calculate a 34-period period exponential moving average of the signed vol- ume from Steps 2 and 3. 5. Calculate a 55-period exponential moving average of the signed volume from Steps 2 and 3. 6. Subtract the 34-period exponential moving average from the 55-period ex- ponential moving average, and plot this difference. 7. Calculate and plot a 13-period exponential moving average of the daily dif- ferences from Step 6. When today’s average price is greater than yesterday’s average price, that is de- fined as accumulation. Conversely, when today’s average price is less than yester- day’s average price, that is defined as distribution. When the sums are equal, the forces of demand and supply are considered to be in balance. The average difference between the number of shares being accumulated and distributed each day is defined as the volume force. A rising trend of volume force is bullish, while a falling trend of Volume: Klinger Oscillator (KO) 763 volume force is bearish. The Klinger Oscillator also is compared to price to identify divergences. Indicator Strategy Example for Klinger Oscillator Based on a 18-year file of daily data for the entire history of the S&P 500 Composite Stock Price Index Futures CSI Perpetual Contract from 4/21/82 to 12/29/00 collected from www.csidata.com, we found that the following parameters would have produced below-average results on a purely mechanical overbought/oversold signal basis with no subjectivity, no sophisticated technical analysis, and no judgement: Enter Long (Buy) at the current daily price close of the S&P 500 Com- posite Stock Price Index futures CSI Perpetual Contract when the current Klinger Oscillator (using the standard parameters, above) crosses above its own trailing 2-day EMA computed as of the previous day’s close. Close Long (Sell) at the current daily price close of the S&P 500 Com- posite Stock Price Index futures CSI Perpetual Contract when the current Klinger Oscillator (using the standard parameters, above) crosses below its own trailing 2-day EMA computed as of the previous day’s close. Enter Short (Sell Short) never. Starting with $100 and reinvesting profits, total net profits would have been $261.46, assuming a fully invested strategy, reinvestment of profits, no transactions costs, and no taxes. This would have been 74.73 percent less than buy-and-hold. No short selling would have been profitable, and no short selling was included in the strategy. The long-only Klinger Oscillator as an indicator would have given profitable buy signals 46.30% of the time. Trading would have been active at one trade every 10.10 calendar days. This long-only Klinger Oscillator trend-following strategy got caught long at the wrong time in the crash of 1987, suffering an unusually large eq- uity drawdown, as the chart clearly shows. Obviously, relatively low profitability with high equity drawdown make an unfavorable combination. The Equis International MetaStock® System Testing rules are written as follows: Enter long: KVO()>Ref(Mov(KVO(),opt1,E),-1) Close long: KVO()<Ref(Mov(KVO(),opt1,E),-1) OPT1 Current value: 2 766 Technical Market Indicators Volume: New York Stock Exchange versus Over-the-Counter The smoothed ratio of the weekly volume on the NYSE divided by the volume Over- the-Counter is interpreted as an indicator of serious investment activity compared to speculative fever. The stocks listed on the NYSE generally are considered to be more conserva- tive, since they represent ownership shares in more seasoned, mature companies. In contrast, the stocks traded Over-the-Counter generally are considered to be more speculative and risky, since they represent ownership shares in younger, sometimes untested companies that may not have experienced many up and down business cy- cles. Of course, there are exceptions to these generalities, but they hold more often than not. Ned Davis Research found that modestly above-average returns would have been gained for long trades only if we buy when the smoothed NYSE/OTC Volume Ratio rises above 102.12%, indicating a cautious, ‘quality’ investment psychology, and then sell our long position when the NYSE/OTC Volume Ratio falls below 96.35%, indicating an excessively ‘speculative’ mass mood. Volume: On-Balance Volume (OBV) On-Balance Volume (OBV) is a price and volume trend quantification popularized by Joseph E. Granville, author of A New Strategy of Daily Stock Market Timing for Max- imum Profit, Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ, 1976. It is easy to calculate: if the price close today is above the close yesterday, then the entire day’s volume is as- signed a plus sign; but if the price close today is below the close yesterday, then the entire day’s volume is assigned a minus sign. Note that it does not matter how much the price changes today, a penny or ten dollars. Only the direction of the price change, up or down, determines the plus or minus sign assigned to the entire day’s volume. Each day’s OBV is cumulated in a running total that can be compared visually to the graph of the pure price trend for confirmation or divergence. Mathematically, today’s OBV input before cumulating can be computed as follows: OBV ( (C-P) / | C-P |) * V where C the current period’s closing price. P the previous period’s closing price. | C-P | the absolute value of the difference between the two closing prices. V the current period’s volume. 768 Technical Market Indicators Since any positive number divided by the absolute value of itself is one, the ex- pression in parentheses serves only to determine the sign, plus or minus. Thus, if the current period’s price change is positive (rising), with C greater than P, volume is as- signed a plus sign for the period. But if C is less than P, the price has fallen and vol- ume is assigned a minus sign for that period. The cumulative running total of daily OBV respects the daily OBV plus or mi- nus sign. This results in a cumulative OBV line that rises every day that price rises and that falls every day that price falls. The day’s volume determines the amount of this rise or fall. There are a variety of ways to analyze OBV using all the technical tools of trend assessment, overbought/oversold oscillators, and divergence analysis. By far the sim- plest way is to use a computer to find an objective trend-following decision rule. The Equis International MetaStock® Indicator Builder formula for plotting Cu- mulative OBV is written as follows: (If(C>Ref(C,-1),1,-1)*V) PREV Indicator Strategy Example for On-Balance Volume Historical data shows that OBV is one of the better volume-based indicators. It beat buy-and-hold strategy by an extremely large margin. Still, it is a slightly less effective indicator than the Volume * Price Momentum Oscillator (V*PMO), particularly on the short side. Based on the number of shares traded each day on the NYSE and the daily prices for the DJIA for 72 years from 1928 to 2001, we found that the following pa- rameters would have produced a positive result on a purely mechanical trend- following signal basis with no subjectivity, no sophisticated technical analysis, and no judgement: Enter Long (Buy) at the current daily price close of the DJIA when the cumulative OBV line crosses above its previous day’s 3-day EMA. Close Long (Sell) at the current daily price close of the DJIA when the cu- mulative OBV line crosses below its previous day’s 3-day EMA. Enter Short (Sell Short) at the current daily price close of the DJIA when the cumulative OBV line crosses below its previous day’s 3-day EMA. Close Short (Cover) at the current daily price close of the DJIA when the cumulative OBV line crosses above its previous day’s 3-day EMA. Starting with $100 and reinvesting profits, total net profits for this OBV strategy would have been $47,999,352, assuming a fully invested strategy, reinvestment of profits, no transactions costs, and no taxes. This would have been 1,165,062.91 772 Technical Market Indicators percent better than buy-and-hold. In contrast to most other volume-based indicators, OBV would have been significantly profitable since the Crash of ’87, despite losses on unprofitable short sales in a record-breaking bull market. Not surprisingly, short sales would have been extremely unprofitable since 1982, while long-only trades would have been very profitable. Trading would have been hyperactive at one trade every 3.50 calendar days. The Equis International MetaStock® System Testing rules are written as follows: Enter long: OBV()>Ref(Mov(OBV(),opt1,E),-1) Close long: OBV()<Ref(Mov(OBV(),opt1,E),-1) Enter short: OBV()<Ref(Mov(OBV(),opt1,E),-1) Close short: OBV()>Ref(Mov(OBV(),opt1,E),-1) OPT1 Current value: 3 Volume Oscillator Oscillators are effective in organizing, or taming, wild and raw market data for use in a systematic trading strategy or investment timing model. For example, we found that a 220-day EMA of Volume can be used to define active or inactive trading activity. By calculating the percentage deviation of volume from its 220-day trend, and graph- ing it, we can visually grasp exactly how much trading activity is above or below normal. For example, we can readily comprehend with a glance at the following chart when stock turnover is, say, 50% above or below normal. Simply subtract from cur- rent volume its own trailing 220-day EMA, divide that difference by the 220-day EMA, then multiply that ratio by 100 in order to convert the ratio fraction to a per- centage, as shown in the following Equis MetaStock® Indicator Builder formula: (V-(Ref(Mov(V,220,E),-1))) /(Ref(Mov(V,220,E),-1))*100; Input(‘Plot a horizontal line at’,-0.25,0.25,0); where V the total volume of trading activity for the period. (Ref(Mov(V,220,E),-1) the previous day’s 220-day EMA of Volume. 774 Technical Market Indicators Volume * Price Momentum Oscillator (V*PMO) Volume * Price Momentum Oscillator (V*PMO) is a price and volume momentum oscillator. Before applying a smoothing, the basic input value of a 1-day V*PMO is expressed as follows: Today’s Input Value for V*PMO V * P where V today’s volume. P today’s price change, close minus the previous day’s close. For example, if today’s price change is a decline of 4 points and today’s volume is 200, then today’s V*PMO input value is 800. Next, compute an exponential moving average of these daily price changes mul- tiplied by volume. This smoothes the erratic daily data enough to allow us to plot a momentum oscillator useful for system development and, possibly, useful for subjec- tive interpretation, including divergence analysis. As with simple momentum indicators generally, when the n-period exponential moving average of V*PMO is positive, momentum is bullish, so we buy, entering or initiating a long position. But when the n-period exponential moving average of V*PMO is negative, we close out long positions and enter a short position. Indicator Strategy Example for the Volume * Price Momentum Oscillator (V*PMO) Historical data shows that the Volume * Price Momentum Oscillator (V*PMO) would have been an effective indicator, particularly on the long side. Based on the number of shares traded each day on the NYSE and the daily prices for the DJIA for 72 years from 1928 to 2001, we found that the following parameters would have produced a significantly positive result on a purely mechanical trend-following signal basis with no subjectivity, no sophisticated technical analysis, and no judgement: Enter Long (Buy) at the current daily price close of the DJIA when the 3-day EMA of the daily V*PMO is greater than zero. Close Long (Sell) at the current daily price close of the DJIA when the 3-day EMA of the daily V*PMO is less than zero. Enter Short (Sell Short) at the current daily price close of the DJIA when the 3-day EMA of the daily V*PMO is less than zero. Close Short (Cover) at the current daily price close of the DJIA when the 3-day EMA of the V*PMO is greater than zero. Volume * Price Momentum Oscillator (V*PMO) 775 Starting with $100 and reinvesting profits, total net profits for the Volume * Price Momentum Oscillator (V*PMO) strategy would have been $ 61,609,220, as- suming a fully invested strategy, reinvestment of profits, no transactions costs, and no taxes. This would have been 1,495,436.39% better than the passive buy-and-hold strategy. Short selling would have been profitable over the full 72 years but unprof- itable since December 1985. Trading would have been hyperactive at one trade every 5.29 calendar days. The Equis International MetaStock® System Testing rules are written as follows: Enter long: Mov((C-Ref(C,-1))*V,opt1,E)>0 Close long: Mov((C-Ref(C,-1))*V,opt1,E)<0 Enter short: Mov((C-Ref(C,-1))*V,opt1,E)<0 Close short: Mov((C-Ref(C,-1))*V,opt1,E)>0 OPT1 Current value: 3 778 Technical Market Indicators Volume Reversal When volume increases and there is a clear directional price range expansion, then there is a Volume Reversal. Volume Reversal was developed by Mark A. Leibovit, a technical analyst who has specialized in transactional activity studies. Leibovit is ed- itor of The Volume Reversal Survey (PO Box 1451, Sedona, AZ 86339), a semi- monthly market newsletter. Volume Reversal is based on the ancient technical analysis observation that volume should increase to confirm a change in directional price movement. Leibovit’s Volume Reversal interpretation depends entirely on the following definitions: • An increase in volume occurs when today’s total transactional activity is greater than the previous day’s volume of trade. • A Rally Day occurs when the current intraday high is higher than the previ- ous day’s high and the current intraday low is the same or higher than the previous day’s low. • A Reaction Day occurs when the current intraday low is lower than the pre- vious day’s low and the current intraday high is the same or lower than the previous day’s high. • A Positive Volume Reversal occurs when a change from a Reaction Day to a Rally Day is accompanied by an increase in volume. It is time to buy. • A Negative Volume Reversal occurs when a change from a Rally Day to a Reaction Day is accompanied by an increase in volume. It is time to sell. Significantly, we should highlight what is specifically ignored as not relevant in Leibovit’s Volume Reversal interpretation: • An Inside Day occurs when the current intraday high is the same or lower than the previous day’s high, and when the current intraday low is the same or higher than the previous day’s low. • An Outside Day occurs when the current intraday high is higher than the previous day’s high, and when the current intraday low is lower than the previous day’s low. • The Close is the last price of the day, and it too counts for nothing. A close examination of the buy and sell arrows on the chart on the facing page should make these definitions clear. In our independent Indicator Strategy testing, this indicator underperformed a passive buy-and-hold strategy in recent years. As the chart of the S&P Depositary Re- cipts shows, a cumulative Volume Reversal indicator peaked out on July 22, 1997, which was too early for practical trading purposes. It appears that Leibovit’s success depends on his good judgement based on his long experience, rather than on any sim- ple, mechanical interpretation of this indicator. 780 Technical Market Indicators The Equis International MetaStock® Indicator Builder Dialog for a cumulative Volume Reversal indicator (similar to On Balance Volume may be written as follows: Cum ((If(H>Ref(H,-1)) AND (L> Ref(L,-1)) AND (V>Ref(V,-1)),V,0)) (If((H< Ref(H,-1)) AND (L<Ref(L,-1)) AND (V>Ref(V,-1)),-V,0))) The Equis International MetaStock® System Testing rules may be written as follows: Enter long: H>Ref(H,-1) AND L> Ref(L,-1) AND V>Ref(V,-1) Close long: H< Ref(H,-1) AND L<Ref(L,-1) AND V>Ref(V,-1) Enter short: H< Ref(H,-1) AND L<Ref(L,-1) AND V>Ref(V,-1) Close short: H>Ref(H,-1) AND L> Ref(L,-1) AND V>Ref(V,-1) Volume Up Days/Down Days 781 Volume Up Days/Down Days The Volume Up Days/Down Days, developed by award-winning technical analyst, Arthur A. Merrill, CMT, is a ratio oscillator calculated by dividing the sum of the to- tal daily volume on the latest five trading days that the price closed higher by the sum of the total daily volume on the most recent five trading days that the price closed lower. The following example should make it clear: Day Volume Price Close: of Shares Traded Up or Down 1 183 Up 2 165 Down 3 177 Down 4 242 Up 5 234 Up 6 212 Down 7 195 Up 8 152 Down 9 145 Down 10 163 Down 11 159 Down 12 180 Up Volume Up Days/Down Days (183 242 234 195 180) (212 152 145 163 159) The result of the above calculation is 1.24. According to Art Merrill’s research, readings above 1.05 are bullish, while readings below 0.95 are bearish. 782 Technical Market Indicators Volume: Williams’ Variable Accumulation Distribution (WVAD) Williams’ Variable Accumulation Distribution (WVAD) is a volume-weighted price momentum indicator, developed by Larry Williams. WVAD is based on the idea that the best measure of a day’s buying power and selling pressure is dependent on the re- lationship between the number of points that the market has moved from its opening price to its closing price for the day. Specifically, it is calculated and interpreted in six steps: 1. Subtract the opening price from the closing price. Respect the sign, plus or minus. 2. Divide that difference (from Step 1) by the difference of the high minus the low. 3. 4. 5. Multiply that ratio (from Step 2) by the volume. Average that product (from Step 3) over a moving window of n-days of time. If the moving average (from Step 4) is positive, net buying pressure is dom- inant so a long position is initiated. 6. If the moving average (from Step 4) is negative, net selling pressure is dom- inant so a short position is initiated. Mathematically, Steps 1 through 3 of the WVAD formula can be expressed as: WVAD ( ((C-O) / (H L)) * V ) where C the current period’s closing price. O the current period’s opening price. H the current period’s high price. L the current period’s low price. V the current period’s volume. For example, if the current day’s opening price was 175, the high was 180, the low was 160, the close was 165, and the volume was 2000 shares, then: WVAD ( ((165-175)/(180-160)) * 2000) 1000 In Step 4, for a 4-period WVAD, for example, this 1000 would become an in- put for a 4-day moving average. In our independent Indicator Strategy testing, this indicator underperformed a passive buy-and-hold strategy. As the chart of the S&P Depositary Receipts shows, such a cumulative WVAD indicator peaked out on April 3, 1998, which was too early for practical trading purposes. It appears that Williams’ success depends on his good judgement based on his long experience, rather than on any simple, mechanical in- terpretation of this indicator. Volume: Williams’ Variable Accumulation Distribution (WVAD) 783 The Equis International MetaStock® Indicator Builder Dialog for a cummulative WVAD indicator may be written: Cum(((C-O)/(H-L))*V). The Equis International MetaStock® System Testing rules may be written as follows: Enter long: Mov(((C-O)/(H-L))*V,opt1,E) > 0 Close long: Mov(((C-O)/(H-L))*V,opt1,E) < 0 Enter short: Mov(((C-O)/(H-L))*V,opt1,E) < 0 Close short: Mov(((C-O)/(H-L))*V,opt1,E) > 0 OPT1 Current value: 4 784 Technical Market Indicators Wall $treet Week (W$W) Technical Market Index The Wall $treet Week (W$W) Technical Market Index was once one of the most widely followed technical market indicators, thanks to the popularity of the PBS weekly television program. It was a consensus index of ten different stock market in- dicators, created by Robert J. Nurock, President/Market Strategist of Investor’s Analysis, Inc., P.O. Box 460, Santa Fe, NM 87504-0460. Bob Nurock was the origi- nal ‘Chief Elf’ and one of the original regular panelists for many years after the show’s inception in 1970. When Bob Nurock gave up show business, his Index left Wall $treet Week with him. Still, Nurock’s Wall $treet Week (W$W) Technical Mar- ket Index is an interesting example of a complex, combination indicator with a highly significant record of performance. Introduced to the Wall $treet Week audience on October 6, 1972, the W$W Technical Market Index was based on the weekly interpretations of ten different tech- nical market indicators. The Index ignored fundamental data on the economy, cor- porate earnings, and dividends. The ten technical market indicator readings were summed into one number designed to facilitate the perception of changes in investor psychology, market action, speculation, and monetary conditions that are often pres- ent at key market turning points. The Index attempted to identify intermediate to long-term market moves (lasting 3-to-6 months, or longer), rather than short-term swings. Nurock designed the Index to both confirm the continuation of a current trend (when the majority of its components are neutral) and also to provide early warning of a change in a prevailing trend (when five or more of its components swing to pos- itive or negative). How Nurock Constructed his Original Wall $treet Week (W$W) Technical Market Index Nurock used the following ten Technical Market Indicators. Nurock stated his inten- tion to update the specific formulas and interpretation levels annually. More current parameters are available separately under each indicator entry in this book. 1. Momentum Ratio measures the percentage difference between the DJIA and its 30-day simple moving average. Divide the DJIA’s latest close by its most recent 30-day simple moving average. The resulting Momentum Os- cillator flashes overbought/oversold warnings when the DJIA deviates more than three percent (3%) from its 30-day simple moving average. When the DJIA is more than three percent (3%) below its 30-day simple moving av- erage, an extreme often registered at market bottoms, this indicator is posi- tive and bullish. When the DJIA is more than three percent (3%) above its 30-day simple moving average, an extreme often registered at market tops, this indicator is negative and bearish. Wall $treet Week (W$W) Technical Market Index 785 2. Hi-Lo Index compares the total number of stocks attaining new highs ver- sus the number dropping to new lows over the past 10 trading days on the NYSE. 10-day moving totals of both new highs and new lows are com- puted and compared. At significant market bottoms, few new highs are at- tained. At market tops, few new lows are registered. A reversal from either extreme confirms a change in market direction. When the number of new highs crosses above the number of new lows, it is positive and bullish. When the number of new highs crosses below the number of new lows, it is negative and bearish. 3. Market Breadth Indicator is a moving total of the net difference between daily advances and declines over the past 10 trading days. This breadth mo- mentum quantifies the underlying strength of market moves by indicating whether or not the majority of stocks are moving in the same direction as the market averages, an important confirmation of general market strength or weakness. It is positive and bullish when this indicator rises from below to above 1000, and it remains positive until it declines 1000 points from its peak. It is negative and bearish when this indicator falls from above to below 1000, and it remains negative until it rises 1000 points from its trough. Readings between 1000 and 1000 are neutral. 4. Arms’ Short-Term Trading Index uses NYSE data to compute a 10-day moving average of (Advances/Declines) / (Advancing Volume/Declining Volume). Readings above 1.20 indicate extreme pessimism and are posi- tive. Readings below .80 indicate extreme optimism and are negative. 5. Percentage of NYSE Stocks Above Their Moving Averages is oversold and therefore positive when less than 30% of NYSE stocks are trading above their own 10-week moving averages and less than 40% of NYSE stocks are trading above their own 30-week moving averages. It is overbought and therefore negative when more than 70% of NYSE stocks are above their own 10-week averages and more than 60% are above their own 30-week moving averages. 6. Premium Ratio on Options divides the average premium on all listed put options by the average premium on all listed call options on a weekly basis. The raw data is from the Options Clearing Corporation (142 W. Jackson Blvd., Chicago, IL 60604). When the Premium Ratio is above 95.5%, it in- dicates investors are overly pessimistic, which is positive. When the Pre- mium Ratio is below 42%, investors are bidding up call prices excessively and are therefore overly optimistic, which is negative. 786 Technical Market Indicators 7. Advisory Service Sentiment survey by Investor’s Intelligence categorizes the forecasts of about 100 stock market newsletters as bullish, bearish, or expecting a market correction. When sentiment becomes distinctly one- sided, a contrary move in the market is anticipated. When the percentage of bears plus half of the percentage expecting a correction rises above 51.5%, it is positive and bullish. When the same calculation results in a reading be- low 35.5%, it is negative and bearish. 8. Low-Priced Activity Ratio relates the level of trading volume in Barron’s Low-Priced Stock Index to volume in the blue-chip DJIA. A ratio above 7.59% indicates high speculative activity, which is negative and bearish. A ratio below 2.82% indicates low speculation and is positive and bullish. 9. Insider Activity Ratio is a ratio of insider sell transactions relative to buy transactions, as compiled weekly by Vickers Stock Research Corporation. A ratio above 3.61 to 1 means that sellers are significantly more numerous than buyers, and that indicates that key corporate insiders believe their stocks are overvalued and a downward price adjustment is likely. A ratio below 1.42 implies that insiders believe their stocks are undervalued and an upward price move is likely. Insiders are usually right. 10. Fed Policy provides a guide to the direction of Federal Reserve Board pol- icy, as reflected by the level of the Federal Funds Rate relative to the Dis- count Rate. The daily closing bid price for Fed Funds is divided by the Discount Rate. These ratios are smoothed by a 4-day average for Friday, Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday each week. Wednesday readings are omit- ted as they are unusually volatile, due to end of the bank week transactions when individual banks even up reserve positions. The 4-day moving aver- age is negative above 125%, indicating a high Fed Funds Rate relative to the Discount Rate and tight money, which usually slows the growth of busi- ness and chokes the stock market. The 4-day moving average is positive be- low 103%, since a low Fed Funds Rate relative to the Discount Rate indicates easy money, which fosters expansion of business and a rising stock market. Wall $treet Week (W$W) Technical Market Index 787 How the Wall Street Week (W$W) Technical Market Index is Compiled The W$W Index is compiled once a week on Friday based on data available as of Thursday’s close for each of the ten indicators. • When an indicator reaches an extreme usually registered at mar ket bottoms, it is positive and bullish, and therefore it is assigned a value of plus one. • When an indicator reaches an extreme usually registered at mar ket tops, it is negative and bearish, and therefore it is assigned a value of minus one. • When an indicator is between extremes, it is neutral, and ther efore it is as- signed a value of zero. • The first time an indicator moves directly from one extreme to another (from positive to negative, or from negative to positive), it is assigned a neutral value of zero. That zero value is maintained until a new plus or mi- nus value is reached. This first-time exception allows for a more gradual dissipation of the initial strong momentum typical of a new trend. Once this assignment of values ( 1, 0, or 1) for each of the ten indicators is complete, the ten values are summed (respecting the sign, positive or negative) to ar- rive at the W$W Index reading for the week. For example, if four indicators are pos- itive and bullish, five are neutral, and one is negative and bearish, the sum would be 4 0 1 3. For another example, if two indicators are bullish, one is neutral, and seven are negative, the sum would be 2 0 7 5. 788 Technical Market Indicators How the Wall $treet Week (W$W) Technical Market Index is Interpreted W$W Current Reading Interpretation 10 Extremely Bullish 9 Extremely Bullish 8 Extremely Bullish 7 Extremely Bullish 6 Extremely Bullish 5 Extremely Bullish 4 Strongly Bullish 3 Bullish 2 Mildly Bullish 1 Neutral 0 Neutral 1 Neutral 2 Mildly Bearish 3 Bearish 4 Strongly Bearish 5 Extremely Bearish 6 Extremely Bearish 7 Extremely Bearish 8 Extremely Bearish 9 Extremely Bearish 10 Extremely Bearish Performance Record of the Wall $treet Week (W$W) Technical Market Index Is Highly Significant The W$W Index’s ability to forecast the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) was independently verified by Arthur A. Merrill, CMT. Merrill examined all positive or bullish index readings of 5 or greater to determine whether or not the DJIA was higher 1, 5, 13, 26 and 52 weeks later. Also, Merrill checked all negative or bearish index readings of 5 or lower to see whether or not the DJIA was lower 1, 5, 13, 26 and 52 weeks later. For the 12.2-year period from October 18, 1974 (the date of W$W Index’s first revision) through December 31, 1986, the W$W Index correctly forecasted the DJIA 58.5% of the time 1 week in advance; 62.6% of the time 5 weeks in advance; 70.4% of the time 13 weeks in advance; 79.5% of the time 26 weeks in advance; and 81.6% of the time 52 weeks in advance. All are highly significant statistical readings. Weighted Moving Average: Moving Position Weighted Arithmetic Mean 789 Weighted Moving Average: Moving Position Weighted Arithmetic Mean A weighted arithmetic mean weights each data observation proportionally by its po- sition in time, with the most recent data assigned the highest weight and the oldest data assigned the lowest weight. The sum of the products (the daily values multiplied by each variable weight) is then divided by the sum of the weights. For example, assume that the market has just closed, and we choose to calculate a 6-day weighted moving average of the daily closing prices for a hypothetical stock. 1. First, we number each of the 6 most recent past daily closing prices, such that the oldest data 5 days ago is numbered ‘day 1’; the data from 4 days ago is numbered ‘day 2’; the data from 3 days ago is numbered ‘day 3’; the data from 2 days ago is numbered ‘day 4’; the data from 1 day ago is numbered ‘day 5’; and the data from today is numbered ‘day 6’. These assigned date position numbers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6) are our weights. 2. Using these weights, multiply the daily closing price 5 days ago by 1; multiply the daily closing price 4 days ago by 2; multiply the daily closing price 3 days ago by 3; multiply the daily closing price 2 days ago by 4; multiply the daily closing price 1 day ago by 5; and multiply the daily closing price today by 6. 3. Sum the 6 products (from Step 2). In this example, the sum of products is 1135. 4. Add up the sum of the weights, which is 1 2 3 4 5 6 21. A shortcut formula for the sum of the weights is 0.5 n (n 1), where n is the number of observations. In this example, the sum of the weights is 0.5 6 ( 6 1 ) 21. 5. Divide the sum of products (from Step 3) by the sum of the weights (from Step 4). In this example, the sum of products divided by the sum of weights is 54. 6-day weighted moving average for a hypothetical stock sum of closing daily products/ price closing sum of from weights multiply price equals products weights 5 days ago 1 50 50 4 days ago 2 51 102 3 days ago 3 53 159 2 days ago 4 56 224 1 day ago 5 60 300 today 6 50 300 sums 21 1135 54 790 Technical Market Indicators Using a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet to calculate a 6-month weighted moving average for the month-end NYSE Composite, and assuming the price is in column B, the following formula is inserted into each cell of column H: (B6*1 B7*2 B8*3 B9*4 B10*5 B11*6)/21 6-month weighted moving average for the month-end NYSE Composite A B C D E F G H sum of month- moving products/ end closing sum of sum of row date price multiply weights equals products products weights 6 2/28/74 51.56 1 51.56 7 3/29/74 50.21 2 100.42 8 4/30/74 47.93 3 143.79 9 5/31/74 45.92 4 183.68 10 6/28/74 44.90 5 224.50 11 7/31/74 41.55 6 249.30 953.25 45.39 12 8/30/74 37.70 1 37.70 939.39 42.73 13 9/30/74 33.45 2 66.90 905.87 39.52 14 10/31/74 38.97 3 116.91 878.99 38.68 15 11/29/74 37.13 4 148.52 843.83 37.74 16 12/31/74 36.13 5 180.65 799.98 36.93 17 1/31/75 40.91 6 245.46 796.14 37.91 18 2/28/75 43.07 1 43.07 801.51 39.54 19 3/31/75 44.21 2 88.42 823.03 41.23 20 4/30/75 46.19 3 138.57 844.69 42.98 21 5/30/75 48.46 4 193.84 890.01 45.03 22 6/30/75 50.85 5 254.25 963.61 47.23 23 7/31/75 47.52 6 285.12 1003.27 47.77 24 8/29/75 46.29 1 46.29 1006.49 47.65 25 9/30/75 44.49 2 88.98 1007.05 46.86 26 10/31/75 47.05 3 141.15 1009.63 46.79 27 11/28/75 48.24 4 192.96 1008.75 47.02 28 12/31/75 47.64 5 238.20 992.70 47.09 29 1/30/76 53.55 6 321.30 1028.88 48.99 30 2/27/76 53.35 1 53.35 1035.94 50.56 31 3/31/76 54.80 2 109.60 1056.56 52.20 32 4/30/76 54.11 3 162.33 1077.74 53.15 33 5/31/76 53.31 4 213.24 1098.02 53.54 34 6/30/76 55.71 5 278.55 1138.37 54.38 35 7/30/76 55.26 6 331.56 1148.63 54.70 Weighted Moving Average: Moving Position Weighted Arithmetic Mean 791 Indicator Strategy Example for Weighted Moving Average Crossover Strategy Based on daily closing prices for the DJIA from January 1900 to March 2001, we found that the following parameters would have produced a significantly positive re- sult on a purely mechanical trend-following signal basis with no subjectivity, no so- phisticated technical analysis, and no judgement: Enter Long (Buy) at the current daily price close of the DJIA when this close is greater than yesterday’s 6-day weighted moving average of the daily closing prices. Close Long (Sell) at the current daily price close of the DJIA when this close is less than yesterday’s 6-day weighted moving average of the daily closing prices. Enter Short (Sell Short) at the current daily price close of the DJIA when this close is less than yesterday’s 6-day weighted moving average of the daily closing prices. Close Short (Cover) at the current daily price close of the DJIA when this close is greater than yesterday’s 6-day weighted moving average of the daily closing prices. Starting with $100 and reinvesting profits, total net profits for this Weighted Moving Average Crossover Strategy would have been $ 10,772,985,856.00, assum- ing a fully invested strategy, reinvestment of profits, no transactions costs and no taxes. This would have been 51,712,052.38 percent greater than the passive buy-and- hold strategy. Short selling would have been profitable and was included in this strat- egy. Only 38.48% of the trades would have been profitable, but this strategy cuts losses quickly and lets profits run. Trading would have been hyperactive at one trade every 5.89 calendar days. The Equis International MetaStock® System Testing rules are written as follows: Enter long: CLOSE > Ref(Mov(CLOSE,opt1,W),-1) Close long: CLOSE < Ref(Mov(CLOSE,opt1,W),-1) Enter short: CLOSE < Ref(Mov(CLOSE,opt1,W),-1) Close short: CLOSE > Ref(Mov(CLOSE,opt1,W),-1) OPT1 Current value: 6 794 Technical Market Indicators Weighting Different Technical Indicators There is an overwhelmingly large number of possible technical indicator combina- tions. Assume we pick just ten indicators from this book and we choose to examine all combinations of these indicators. We would have to examine ten to the 10th power number of combinations, or ten billion combinations. The number of possibilities mushrooms when we assign variable weights to different indicators, for example, ac- cording to their historical effectiveness. William Eckhardt (see Schwager, Jack, The New Market Wizards, Harper- Collins Publishers, 10 E. 53rd Street, New York, NY 10022, page 109), a trader and mathematician, stated that assigning weights tends to be assumption-laden regarding the relationship among the indicators. The literature on robust statistics implies that the best strategy is not some optimized weighting scheme, but rather weighting each indicator by 1 or 0. In other words, accept or reject. If the indicator is good enough to be used at all, it’s good enough to be weighted equally with the other ones. If it is not good enough, exclude it entirely. An alternate approach is used by Arthur A. Merrill, CMT, who has many decades of experience as both a professional statistician and technical analyst. He ob- serves that at any given time some indicators are bullish while others are bearish, and it is only human nature to see only those that confirm preconceived opinion. Merrill’s solution to this problem is to objectively weight the indicators by past performance. First, he measures each indicator by its accuracy in forecasting the direction of the DJIA over 1, 5, 13, 26, and 52 weeks ahead, giving progressively greater weight to the longer time periods, which generally provide the most accurate forecasts. Merrill defines accuracy by the number of correct forecasts divided by the total number of forecasts. He further quantifies accuracy by the chi squared test of statistical signifi- cance with one degree of freedom. Merrill translates this significance data for all of his indicators into weights proportional to the logs of chi square, which is his own original innovation. Finally, he divides the sum of all bullish weights by the sums of all bullish plus all bearish weights for a totally objective weight of the statistical evi- dence he calls the Technical Trend Balance. Criteria for including, excluding, and weighting indicators should be based on the investor’s objectives, logic and common sense, and historical risk-adjusted returns simulated over many decades of unseen historical data. Also, each component indi- cator should be analyzed and followed separately to allow the technical analyst to perceive possible changes in each indicator’s behavior. On occasion, such changes have been substantial over time for some indicators, due to structural changes in the trading environment. About the Author 795 Wilder’s Smoothing Wilder’s Smoothing was developed by J. Welles Wilder, Jr., who may best be known as the developer of Directional Movement and RSI. Wilder used a formula for smoothing nearly identical to the more widely accepted exponential smoothing (See Exponential Moving Average). When Wilder mentions dividing by a smoothing num- ber of 14, for a very close approximation use an Exponential Moving Average num- ber of days of 28. Both smoothing methods allocate decreasingly smaller weight each day to all historical data in the series. Williams’ Percent Range (%R) This indicator, attributed to Larry Williams (P.O. Box 8162, Rancho Santa Fe, CA 92067), is the exact inverse of Stochastics, which is a more popular version of the same thing. (See Stochastics.)

                    new {role="system", content="These refer to a (non exclusive) list of rules you should follow when answering. PREAMBLE CFP Board’s Code of Ethics and Standards of Conduct reflects the commitment that all CFP® professionals make to high standards of competency and ethics. CFP Board’s Code and Standards benefits and protects the public, provides standards for delivering financial planning, and advances financial planning as a distinct and valuable profession. Compliance with the Code and Standards is a requirement of CFP® certification that is critical to the integrity of the CFP® marks. Violations of the Code and Standards may subject a CFP® professional to discipline. CODE OF ETHICS A CFP® professional must: 1. Act with honesty, integrity, competence, and diligence. 2. Act in the client’s best interests. 3. Exercise due care. 4. Avoid or disclose and manage conflicts of interest. 5. Maintain the confidentiality and protect the privacy of client information. 6. Act in a manner that reflects positively on the financial planning profession and CFP® certification. STANDARDS OF CONDUCT A. DUTIES OWED TO CLIENTS 1. FIDUCIARY DUTY At all times when providing Financial Advice to a Client, a CFP® professional must act as a fiduciary, and therefore, act in the best interests of the Client. The following duties must be fulfilled: a. Duty of Loyalty. A CFP® professional must: i. Place the interests of the Client above the interests of the CFP® professional and the CFP® Professional’s Firm; ii. Avoid Conflicts of Interest, or fully disclose Material Conflicts of Interest to the Client, obtain the Client’s informed consent, and properly manage the conflict; and iii. Act without regard to the financial or other interests of the CFP® professional, the CFP® Professional’s Firm, or any individual or entity other than the Client, which means that a CFP® professional acting under a Conflict of Interest continues to have a duty to act in the best interests of the Client and place the Client’s interests above the CFP® professional’s. b. Duty of Care. A CFP® professional must act with the care, skill, prudence, and diligence that a prudent professional would exercise in light of the Client’s goals, risk tolerance, objectives, and financial and personal circumstances. c. Duty to Follow Client Instructions. A CFP® professional must comply with all objectives, policies, restrictions, and other terms of the Engagement and all reasonable and lawful directions of the Client. 2. INTEGRITY a. A CFP® professional must perform Professional Services with integrity. Integrity demands honesty and candor, which may not be subordinated to personal gain or advantage. Allowance may be made for innocent error and legitimate differences of opinion, but integrity cannot co-exist with deceit or subordination of principle. 3 b. A CFP® professional may not, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of Professional Services: i. Employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud; ii. Make any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; or iii. Engage in any act, practice, or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person. 3. COMPETENCE A CFP® professional must provide Professional Services with competence, which means with relevant knowledge and skill to apply that knowledge. When the CFP® professional is not sufficiently competent in a particular area to provide the Professional Services required under the Engagement, the CFP® professional must gain competence, obtain the assistance of a competent professional, limit or terminate the Engagement, and/or refer the Client to a competent professional. The CFP® professional shall describe to the Client any requested Professional Services that the CFP® professional will not be providing. 4. DILIGENCE A CFP® professional must provide Professional Services, including responding to reasonable Client inquiries, in a timely and thorough manner. 5. DISCLOSE AND MANAGE CONFLICTS OF INTEREST a. Disclose Conflicts. When providing Financial Advice, a CFP® professional must make full disclosure of all Material Conflicts of Interest with the CFP® professional’s Client that could affect the professional relationship. This obligation requires the CFP® professional to provide the Client with sufficiently specific facts so that a reasonable Client would be able to understand the CFP® professional’s Material Conflicts of Interest and the business practices that give rise to the conflicts, and give informed consent to such conflicts or reject them. A sincere belief by a CFP® professional with a Material Conflict of Interest that he or she is acting in the best interests of the Client is insufficient to excuse failure to make full disclosure. i. A CFP® professional must make full disclosure and obtain the consent of the Client before providing any Financial Advice regarding which the CFP® professional has a Material Conflict of Interest. ii. In determining whether the disclosure about a Material Conflict of Interest provided to the Client was sufficient to infer that a Client has consented to a Material Conflict of Interest, CFP Board will evaluate whether a reasonable Client receiving the disclosure would have understood the conflict and how it could affect the advice the Client will receive from the CFP® professional. The greater the potential harm the conflict presents to the Client, and the more significantly a business practice that gives rise to the conflict departs from commonly accepted practices among CFP® professionals, the less likely it is that CFP Board will infer informed consent absent clear evidence of informed consent. Ambiguity in the disclosure provided to the Client will be interpreted in favor of the Client. iii. Evidence of oral disclosure of a conflict will be given such weight as CFP Board in its judgment deems appropriate. Written consent to a conflict is not required. b. Manage Conflicts. A CFP® professional must adopt and follow business practices reasonably designed to prevent Material Conflicts of Interest from compromising the CFP® professional’s ability to act in the Client’s best interests. 6. SOUND AND OBJECTIVE PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENT A CFP® professional must exercise professional judgment on behalf of the Client that is not subordinated to the interest of the CFP® professional or others. A CFP® professional may not solicit or accept any gift, gratuity, entertainment, non-cash compensation, or other consideration that reasonably could be expected to compromise the CFP® professional’s objectivity. 4 7. PROFESSIONALISM A CFP® professional must treat Clients, prospective Clients, fellow professionals, and others with dignity, courtesy, and respect. 8. COMPLY WITH THE LAW a. A CFP® professional must comply with the laws, rules, and regulations governing Professional Services. b. A CFP® professional may not intentionally or recklessly participate or assist in another person’s violation of these Standards or the laws, rules, or regulations governing Professional Services. 9. CONFIDENTIALITY AND PRIVACY a. b. c. d. A CFP® professional must keep confidential and may not disclose any non-public personal information about any prospective, current, or former Client (“client”), except that the CFP® professional may disclose information: i. For ordinary business purposes: a) With the client’s consent, so long as the client has not withdrawn the consent; b) To a CFP® Professional’s Firm or other persons with whom the CFP® professional is providing services to or for the client, when necessary to perform those services; c) As necessary to provide information to the CFP® professional’s attorneys, accountants, and auditors; and d) To a person acting in a representative capacity on behalf of the client; ii. For legal and enforcement purposes: a) To law enforcement authorities concerning suspected unlawful activities, to the extent permitted by the law; b) As required to comply with federal, state, or local law; c) As required to comply with a properly authorized civil, criminal, or regulatory investigation or examination, or subpoena or summons, by a governmental authority; d) As necessary to defend against allegations of wrongdoing made by a governmental authority; e) As necessary to present a civil claim against, or defend against a civil claim raised by, a client; f) As required to comply with a request from CFP Board concerning an investigation or adjudication; and g) As necessary to provide information to professional organizations that are assessing the CFP® professional’s compliance with professional standards. A CFP® professional may not use any non-public personal information about a client for his or her direct or indirect personal benefit, whether or not it causes detriment to the client, unless the client consents. A CFP® professional, either directly or through the CFP® Professional’s Firm, must take reasonable steps to protect the security of non-public personal information about any client, including the security of information stored physically or electronically, from unauthorized access that could result in harm or inconvenience to the client. A CFP® professional, either directly or through the CFP® Professional’s Firm, must adopt and implement policies regarding the protection, handling, and sharing of a client’s non-public personal information and must provide a client with written notice of those policies at the time of the Engagement and thereafter not less than annually (at least once in any 12-month period) unless (i) the CFP® professional’s policies have not changed since the last notice sent to a client; and (ii) the CFP® professional does not disclose non-public personal information other than as permitted without a client’s consent. 5 e. A CFP® professional shall be deemed to comply with this Section if the CFP® Professional’s Firm is subject to, and the CFP® professional complies with, Regulation S-P under the federal securities laws or substantially equivalent federal or state laws or rules. 10. PROVIDE INFORMATION TO A CLIENT a. b. c. When Providing Financial Advice. When providing or agreeing to provide Financial Advice that does not require Financial Planning in accordance with the Practice Standards, a CFP® professional must provide the following information to the Client, prior to or at the time of the Engagement, and document that the information has been provided to the Client: i. A description of the services and products to be provided; ii. How the Client pays for the products and services, and a description of the additional types of costs that the Client may incur, including product management fees, surrender charges, and sales loads; iii. How the CFP® professional, the CFP® Professional’s Firm, and any Related Party are compensated for providing the products and services; iv. The existence of any public discipline or bankruptcy, and the location(s), if any, of the webpages of all relevant public websites of any governmental authority, self-regulatory organization, or professional organization that sets forth the CFP® professional’s public disciplinary history or any personal bankruptcy or business bankruptcy where the CFP® professional was a Control Person; v. The information required under Section A.5.a. (Conflict of Interest Disclosure); vi. The information required under Section A.9.d. (Written Notice Regarding Non-Public Personal Information); vii. The information required under Section A.13.a.ii. (Disclosure of Economic Benefit for Referral or Engagement of Additional Persons); and viii. Any other information about the CFP® professional or the CFP® Professional’s Firm that is Material to a Client’s decision to engage or continue to engage the CFP® professional or the CFP® Professional’s Firm. When Providing Financial Planning. When providing or required to provide Financial Planning in accordance with the Practice Standards, a CFP® professional must provide the following information to the Client, prior to or at the time of the Engagement, in one or more written documents: i. The information required to be provided in Sections A.10.a.i.-iv. and vi.-viii.; and ii. The terms of the Engagement between the Client and the CFP® professional or the CFP® Professional’s Firm, including the Scope of Engagement and any limitations, the period(s) during which the services will be provided, and the Client’s responsibilities. A CFP® professional is responsible for implementing, monitoring, and updating the Financial Planning recommendation(s) unless specifically excluded from the Scope of Engagement. Updating Information. A CFP® professional has an ongoing obligation to provide to the Client any information that is a Material change or update to the information required to be provided to the Client. Material changes and updates to public disciplinary history or bankruptcy information must be disclosed to the Client within ninety (90) days, together with the location(s) of the relevant webpages. 11. DUTIES WHEN COMMUNICATING WITH A CLIENT A CFP® professional must provide a Client with accurate information, in accordance with the Engagement, and in response to reasonable Client requests, in a manner and format that a Client reasonably may be expected to understand. 6 12. DUTIES WHEN REPRESENTING COMPENSATION METHOD A CFP® professional may not make false or misleading representations regarding the CFP® professional’s or the CFP® Professional’s Firm’s method(s) of compensation. a. Specific Representations b. c. i. Fee-Only. A CFP® professional may represent his or her or the CFP® Professional’s Firm’s compensation method as “fee-only” only if: a) The CFP® professional and the CFP® Professional’s Firm receive no Sales-Related Compensation; and b) Related Parties receive no Sales-Related Compensation in connection with any Professional Services the CFP® professional or the CFP® Professional’s Firm provides to Clients. ii. Fee-Based. CFP Board uses the term “fee and commission” to describe the compensation method of those who receive both fees and Sales-Related Compensation. A CFP® professional who represents that his or her or the CFP® Professional’s Firm’s compensation method is “fee- based” or any other similar term that is not fee-only: a) May not use the term in a manner that suggests the CFP® professional or the CFP® Professional’s Firm is fee-only; and b) Must clearly state that either the CFP® professional or the CFP® Professional’s Firm earns fees and commissions, or that the CFP® professional or the CFP® Professional’s Firm are not fee- only. Sales-Related Compensation. Sales-Related Compensation is more than a de minimis economic benefit, including any bonus or portion of compensation, resulting from a Client purchasing or selling Financial Assets, from a Client holding Financial Assets for purposes other than receiving Financial Advice, or from the referral of a Client to any person or entity other than the CFP® Professional’s Firm. Sales-Related Compensation includes, for example, commissions, trailing commissions, 12b-1 fees, spreads, transaction fees, revenue sharing, referral or solicitor fees, or similar consideration. Sales-Related Compensation does not include: i. Soft dollars (any research or other benefits received in connection with Client brokerage that qualifies for the “safe harbor” of Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934); ii. Reasonable and customary fees for custodial or similar administrative services if the fee or amount of the fee is not determined based on the amount or value of Client transactions; iii. Non-monetary benefits provided by another service provider, including a custodian, that benefit the CFP® professional’s Clients by improving the CFP® professional’s delivery of Professional Services, and that are not determined based on the amount or value of Client transactions; iv. Reasonable and customary fees for Professional Services, other than for solicitations and referrals, the CFP® professional or CFP® Professional’s Firm provides to a Client that are collected and distributed by another service provider, including under a Turnkey Asset Management Platform; or v. A fee the Related Party solicitor receives for soliciting clients for the CFP® professional or the CFP® Professional’s Firm. Related Party. A person or business entity (including a trust) whose receipt of Sales-Related Compensation a reasonable CFP® professional would view as directly or indirectly benefiting the CFP® professional or the CFP® Professional’s Firm, including, for example, as a result of the CFP® professional’s ownership stake in the business entity. There is a rebuttable presumption that a Related Party includes: i. Family Members. A member of the CFP® professional’s Family and any business entity that the Family or members of the Family Control; and ii. Business Entities. A business entity that the CFP® professional or the CFP® Professional’s Firm Controls, or that is Controlled by or is under common Control with, the CFP® Professional’s Firm. 7 13. 14. 15. d. In Connection with any Professional Services. Sales-Related Compensation received by a Related Party is “in connection with any Professional Services” if it results, directly or indirectly, from Client transactions referred or facilitated by the CFP® professional or the CFP® Professional’s Firm. e. Safe Harbor for Related Parties. Sales-Related Compensation received by a Related Party is not “in connection with any Professional Services” if the CFP® professional or the CFP® Professional’s Firm adopts and implements policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent the CFP® professional or the CFP® Professional’s Firm from recommending that any Client purchase Financial Assets from or through, or refer any Clients to, the Related Party. f. Misrepresentations by a CFP® Professional’s Firm. A CFP® professional who Controls the CFP® Professional’s Firm may not allow the CFP® Professional’s Firm to make a representation of compensation method that would be false or misleading if made by the CFP® professional. A CFP® professional who does not Control the CFP® Professional’s Firm must correct a CFP® Professional’s Firm’s misrepresentations of compensation method by accurately representing the CFP® professional’s compensation method to the CFP® professional’s Clients. DUTIES WHEN RECOMMENDING, ENGAGING, AND WORKING WITH ADDITIONAL PERSONS a. When engaging or recommending the selection or retention of additional persons to provide financial or Professional Services for a Client, a CFP® professional must: i. Have a reasonable basis for the recommendation or Engagement based on the person’s reputation, experience, and qualifications; ii. Disclose to the Client, at the time of the recommendation or prior to the Engagement, any arrangement by which someone who is not the Client will compensate or provide some other material economic benefit to the CFP® professional, the CFP® Professional’s Firm, or a Related Party for the recommendation or Engagement; and iii.

FINANCIAL PLANNING AND APPLICATION OF THE PRACTICE STANDARDS FOR THE FINANCIAL PLANNING PROCESS 1. Financial Planning Definition. Financial Planning is a collaborative process that helps maximize a Client’s potential for meeting life goals through Financial Advice that integrates relevant elements of the Client’s personal and financial circumstances. 2. Examples of Relevant Elements of the Client’s Personal and Financial Circumstances. Relevant elements of personal and financial circumstances vary from Client to Client, and may include the Client’s need for or desire to: develop goals, manage assets and liabilities, manage cash flow, identify and manage risks, identify and manage the financial effect of health considerations, provide for educational needs, achieve financial security, preserve or increase wealth, identify tax considerations, prepare for retirement, pursue philanthropic interests, and address estate and legacy matters. 3. Application of Practice Standards. The Practice Standards set forth the Financial Planning Process. A CFP® professional must comply with the Practice Standards when: a. The CFP® professional agrees to provide or provides: i. Financial Planning; or ii. Financial Advice that requires integration of relevant elements of the Client’s personal and/ or financial circumstances in order to act in the Client’s best interests (“Financial Advice that Requires Financial Planning”); or b. The Client has a reasonable basis to believe the CFP® professional will provide or has provided Financial Planning. 4. Integration Factors. Among the factors that CFP Board will weigh in determining whether a CFP® professional has agreed to provide or provided Financial Advice that Requires Financial Planning are: a. The number of relevant elements of the Client’s personal and financial circumstances that the Financial Advice may affect; b. The portion and amount of the Client’s Financial Assets that the Financial Advice may affect; c. The length of time the Client’s personal and financial circumstances may be affected by the Financial Advice; d. The effect on the Client’s overall exposure to risk if the Client implements the Financial Advice; and e. The barriers to modifying the actions taken to implement the Financial Advice. 5. CFP Board Evaluation. In a disciplinary proceeding in which a CFP® professional denies CFP Board’s allegation that the CFP® professional was required to comply with the Practice Standards, the CFP® professional must demonstrate that compliance with the Practice Standards was not required. 6. No Client Agreement to Engage for Financial Planning. If a CFP® professional otherwise must comply with the Practice Standards, but the Client does not agree to engage the CFP® professional to provide Financial Planning, the CFP® professional must either: a. Not enter into the Engagement; b. Limit the Scope of Engagement to services that do not require application of the Practice Standards, and describe to the Client the services the Client requests that the CFP® professional will not be performing; c. Provide the requested services after informing the Client how Financial Planning would benefit the Client and how the decision not to engage the CFP® professional to provide Financial Planning may limit the CFP® professional’s Financial Advice, in which case the CFP® professional is not required to comply with the Practice Standards; or d. Terminate the Engagement. 9 C. PRACTICE STANDARDS FOR THE FINANCIAL PLANNING PROCESS In complying with the Practice Standards, a CFP® professional must act prudently in documenting information, as the facts and circumstances require, taking into account the significance of the information, the need to preserve the information in writing, the obligation to act in the Client’s best interests, and the CFP® Professional’s Firm’s policies and procedures. 1.
